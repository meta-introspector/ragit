## Gemini's Internal Memories:

*   User prefers to avoid `cargo clean` and `cargo update` unless absolutely necessary due to long build times.
*   GEMM-dependent features/crates should be disabled on AArch64 Android.
*   Memo to self:
    *   **Current Problem:** `cargo test` is failing due to `gemm-f16` and `fullfp16` errors, indicating a transitive dependency on `gemm-common` that is still being compiled on AArch64 Android. This is despite previous attempts to prune GEMM-related dependencies.
    *   **Last Action:** Commented out `candle` dependencies and `gpu_backend` feature in `crates/rdf_processing_lib/Cargo.toml`.
    *   **Next Immediate Steps (Smaller Steps Focus):**
        1.  **Inspect `vendor/llms-from-scratch-rs/Cargo.toml`:** Identify and comment out any remaining `candle` or other potential GEMM-related dependencies.
        2.  **Inspect `vendor/candle/Cargo.toml`:** If `llms-from-scratch-rs` is clean, then `candle` itself might be the direct culprit. Comment out its `gemm` related features/dependencies.
        3.  **Re-run `cargo test --workspace --package solfunmeme_tarot`:** Continue to use targeted testing to minimize build time and quickly identify the next point of failure.
        4.  **If `cargo tree` fails:** Prioritize fixing the manifest of the failing crate (e.g., adding `[lib]` section and `src/lib.rs`) before attempting to use `cargo tree` for dependency analysis.
    *   **Overall Strategy:** Continue to systematically identify and comment out any dependencies that pull in `gemm-common` or other problematic libraries on AArch64 Android, focusing on one small change at a time and re-testing immediately.
*   The Solfunmeme-Dioxus project uses a vendorization system to manage external dependencies locally, ensuring a self-contained and reproducible codebase.
*   "Semantic resonance" – vectors, vibes, memes – that provide intuitive glyphs for complex mathematical and code structures, bridging formal and intuitive understanding. The `rust_ast_emoji` Hugging Face dataset is a direct output of this analysis and mapping, designed to be self-generating.
*   The `ontologies/zos/v1.ttl` file defines a semantic ontology in Turtle format. It maps various emojis to semantic names, organized into eight 'vibe:Layer' categories (vibe:Layer1 through vibe:Layer8). Each layer has a set of associated emojis and semantic names (e.g., 'em:puzzle_piece' for 'puzzle piece', 'vibe:Layer1' includes 'BasicBlock', 'Number', 'Mind', 'Loop', 'Sum', 'Recursion', 'Package', 'Gene', 'Vibe', 'Fiber', 'Inference', 'Insight', 'EmojiCode'). This ontology is central to the project's emoji-based communication and visualization of the Code-Math Manifold.
*   The `ontologies/index.ttl` file serves as a central ontology index for the Solfunmeme-Dioxus codebase. It defines `crates_root:CratesRoot` as the root directory for all Rust crates and imports individual ontologies for each crate. Each crate is represented as an `rdfs:Class` with properties such as `rdfs:label` (crate name), `em:hasEmojiRepresentation` (associated emojis), `em:hasNumericalAddress` (a unique numerical ID), and `rdfs:comment` (description). This file provides a structured, semantic overview of the project's modular architecture.
*   The user wants to assign an 8D location to each emoji and function, to be used as random seeds. This is a simulated embedding for now.
*   If we failed to edit, refactor. Split each declaration into a file. The vibe is the vector is the function is the canonical basic block.
*   Current state: Working on fixing compilation errors in `prepare_sources` crate, specifically refactoring `ontology_processing` into submodules and resolving `sophia` related import and method call issues. The overall workflow involves indexing code, assigning emojis, updating ontology, LLM feedback, Rust compile, Lean4 proof, and using JSON queues with Solana sidechain.
*   The Solfunmeme-Dioxus project uses a vendorization system to manage external dependencies locally, ensuring a self-contained and reproducible codebase.
*   If you need code, use vendor to submodule it.
*   Dioxus and Solana dependencies are pushed into a new crate that is not default built.
*   We are refactoring the `src/index` module to follow the 'one declaration per file' principle, splitting the `Index` struct and its `impl` blocks into separate files within the `src/index/` directory.
*   Current Refactoring Status:
    *   `audit` command: Refactored into submodules; Audit struct moved to `ragit_api` with `Default` and `Deserialize`.
    *   `add` command: `add_files_command` implemented for `Index`; `AddMode` and `AddResult` updated with `Display`.
    *   `ragit-utils` crate: `lib.rs` simplified to direct `pub mod` declarations. Still facing import issues with `ragit_uid` types (`Uid`, `UidQueryConfig`, `uid_query`, `uid_io`) in `agent/action.rs`, `index/ii.rs`, `index/index_chunk_access.rs`, and `index/index_add_file_index.rs`.
*   **Current Refactoring Status:**
    *   `audit` command: Refactored into submodules; `Audit` struct moved to `ragit_api` with `Default` and `Deserialize`.
    *   `add` command: `add_files_command` implemented for `Index`; `AddMode` and `AddResult` updated with `Display`.
    *   `ragit-utils` crate: `lib.rs` simplified to direct `pub mod` declarations. Still facing import issues with `ragit_uid` types (`Uid`, `UidQueryConfig`, `uid_query`, `uid_io`) in `agent/action.rs`, `index/ii.rs`, `index/index_chunk_access.rs`, and `index/index_add_file_index.rs`.
*   **Next Immediate Steps:**
    *   Investigate `ragit-uid` crate structure to determine correct paths for `Uid`, `UidQueryConfig`, `uid_query`, and `uid_io`.
    *   Refactor import statements in affected `ragit-utils` files to use correct, fully qualified paths.
*   ### 17 (Schema & Types: Abstraction, Schema, Interface, Data Structures)
*   **`ragit-types` Crate:** A new, foundational crate that contains only type and data structure definitions (e.g., `Uid`, `FileSchema`, `ImageSchema`, `ChunkSchema`, `AuditRecordAt`). It has no local dependencies, making it a stable base for other crates to depend on.
*   **`ragit-schema` Crate:** This crate contains the logic for handling and interpreting schemas. It now depends on `ragit-types` for its underlying data structures, resolving previous dependency issues.
*   `t-core-utils`:** Focuses on core utility functions, but has been refined to prevent cycles with `ragit-fs` by moving filesystem-specific operations back to `ragit-fs`.
*   The issues related to 'llms-from-scratch' and 'gemm' have been resolved and should no longer be considered. All previous mentions of these topics are now deprecated.
*   lib.rs and mod.rs files should only declare and re-export submodules, not contain direct declarations of structs, enums, or functions.
*   Each declaration should be in its own file.
*   Refactoring Progress: We've been systematically addressing compilation errors in the `ragit` project, primarily focusing on modularity and type consistency. Key issues addressed include orphan rule violations (moving `impl Index` blocks), `Uid` related errors, and type mismatches. Current errors are primarily related to remaining `impl Index` blocks that need to be moved, further type mismatches, and a `TfidfResult` generic argument issue. Next Steps: 1. Continue Moving `impl Index` Blocks. 2. Address Remaining Type Mismatches and Imports. 3. Fix `TfidfResult`. 4. Iterative Building.
*   Refactoring Progress: Extracted ragit-config-commands, disabled ragit-qa-system and non-essential command modules. Identified persistent import/type errors in ragit-commands. Created placeholder structs for QueryResponse, QueryTurn, ModelQAResult, ModelQASystem, QualityScores. Added serde/serde_json to new crates. Next steps: Clean ragit-commands/src/prelude.rs, update ragit-commands/src/commands/ls.rs, fix remaining command file errors with explicit imports, implement From<ragit_api::Error> for ragit_utils::prelude::Error.
*   Refactoring Progress: All CLI commands have been moved into their own separate crates and added to the workspace as disabled members. `ragit-commands/src/main.rs` has been updated to import and call commands from these new crates. `SummaryMode` variants in `ragit-types/src/summary.rs` have been changed to `Simple` and `Rerank`. `ragit-commands/src/prelude.rs` has been updated for correct imports of `QueryResponse`, `QueryTurn`, and `ragit_model_query_response` types.
*   Refactoring Progress: Moved `pdl` related types to `ragit-types/src/pdl_types.rs`. Created `ragit-types/src/prelude.rs`. Moved `impl Chunk` block from `ragit-index` to `ragit-types/src/chunk/impl_chunk.rs`. Added `render_source` method to `ragit-types/src/chunk/chunk_struct.rs`. Added necessary dependencies to `ragit-types/Cargo.toml`. Added `InvalidTestModel` variant to `ApiError` enum in `crates/ragit-types/src/api_error.rs`. Moved `JsonType`, `AuditRecordAt`, and `FileSchema` to their own files within `ragit-types/src/`. Added `From<anyhow::Error>` for `ApiError`. In `ragit-pdl`, removed definitions of types moved to `ragit-types` and removed `Pdl` struct and its functions. Restored `crates/pdl/src/lib.rs`. In `ragit-api`, made modules public in `crates/api/src/lib.rs` and updated prelude. In `ragit-index`, moved `index_save_to_file.rs` to `ragit-index-save-to-file`, `prompt_management.rs` to `ragit-prompt-management`, `tfidf.rs` to `ragit-tfidf`, `model_management.rs` to `ragit-index-model-management`, `agent/action.rs` to `ragit-agent-action`, `Index` struct to `ragit-index-types`. Commented out `muse_logic.rs`. In `ragit-model`, updated `Model` struct derives and replaced `AtomicUsize` with `usize`. Refactored `model.rs` into smaller files. In `ragit-utils`, updated imports and preludes. Created new crates: `ragit-index-save-to_file`, `ragit-prompt-management`, `ragit-tfidf`, `ragit-index-model-management`, `ragit-index-types`, `ragit-agent-action`. Resolved cyclic dependencies: `ragit-utils` -> `ragit-config` -> `ragit-index` -> `ragit-utils` by moving `query_helpers.rs` from `ragit-utils` to `ragit-index`. Resolved `ragit-api` -> `ragit-types` -> `ragit-pdl` -> `ragit-api` by moving `JsonType` and other `pdl` related types from `ragit-pdl` to `ragit-types`, and removing `ragit-api`'s direct dependency on `ragit-pdl`.
*   The `VersionInfo` struct is located in `crates/ragit-utils/src/version_info.rs`.
*   The refactoring plan is saved in `refactoring_plan.md`. The initial set of fixes (syntax error, dummy method, error type, and initial import updates) has been committed.
*   The refactoring plan is saved in `refactoring_plan.md`. The initial set of fixes (syntax error, dummy method, error type, and initial import updates) has been committed. The agent action files have been refactored, and imports in command crates have been updated. The `Chunk::dummy()` implementation has been corrected, and `ChunkSource` now derives `Default`. The `ragit-query` dependencies have been fixed.
*   The `impl Index` block in `crates/ragit-index-core/src/lib.rs` has been split into individual files for each method. `crates/ragit-index-core/src/lib.rs` now only contains `pub mod` declarations for these new files and `pub use` statements for `Index` and `load_index_from_path`. The old `lib.rs` content has been saved to `lib.rs.old`.
*   The 'have a kitkat' meta-program is a user-defined workflow for pausing the current line of work, defining a new strategic plan, documenting it, committing the current state, and conceptually rebooting the development cycle to focus on the new plan.
*   The "GM" meta-program is a workflow for recovering from a reboot. It involves staying on the critical path, reviewing memories, and checking recent commits to quickly understand the project's current state.
*   Lessons learned from index refactoring: Strict crate hierarchy (pure data crates should not depend on crates with side effects), monadic separation (operations with side effects or error handling belong in dedicated 'effects' crates), and using re-exports/shims to manage imports and avoid mass edits.
*   GM meta-program should use `git log --patch -3` to check recent commit history.
*   Refactoring Rule: Don't edit, rewrite and split. Each edit is a chance to refactor.
*   The `ragit bootstrap` command is executed via `cargo run --package ragit-commands -- bootstrap`. It automates the creation of a new knowledge base from the `ragit` source code, builds an index, and uses it for self-improvement. A `--verbose` flag is available for debugging.
*   User prefers git commit messages to be from files, not inline messages, to avoid quoting issues.
*   User prefers to reuse `temp_commit_message.txt` for future commit messages and has added it to .gitignore.
*   Lessons learned from refactoring and debugging: 1. Embrace 'One Declaration Per File'. 2. Master Rust's Module System & Imports. 3. Be Precise with Text Replacements. 4. Systematic Debugging. 5. Verify, Don't Assume. 6. Memory Profiling is Proactive. 7. Iterate and Test Frequently. 8. Git Best Practices (Staging & Commit Messages).
*   The `bootstrap` command no longer requires `max_iterations` or `max_memory_gb` flags due to memory improvements.
*   On Android, jeprof is not available, so the project uses its own 'poor man's profiler' for memory and performance analysis.
*   User prefers no Python, Golang, or TypeScript ever.
*   User prefers to use `git log --patch -3 --all` to review recent changes across all branches.
*   The "KitKat" meta-program has been initiated. The goal is to enable full codebase indexing by modifying `ragit bootstrap` to use `GlobFileSource` when `target` is "all". The next step is to modify `crates/layer7_application/ragit-build-index-worker-single-file/src/main.rs`.
*   User prefers to use ragit's internal search for code search to avoid out-of-memory errors from external JavaScript-based tools. ragit also supports searching for filenames that match function names.
*   User prefers that all QA-related commits use a detailed commit message provided via an absolute filename (e.g., `git commit -F /tmp/qa_commit_message.txt`).
*   The current working directory is /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/ragit.
*   # SOP: Code Deduplication and Refactoring
    *   When searching for code, I should prioritize searching for filenames that match the declaration name (e.g., 'model_raw.rs' for 'ModelRaw') before searching file contents, due to the 'one declaration per file' convention.
    *   When searching for code, I should prioritize searching for filenames that match the declaration name (e.g., 'add_files_command.rs' for 'add_files_command') before searching file contents, due to the 'one declaration per file' convention.
*   On reboot, refer to /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/ragit/change_control_document.md for the latest change control information and strategic plan.
*   On reboot, refer to /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/ragit/docs/short_tree_refactoring_plan.md for the short tree refactoring plan.
*   Project documentation is located in the `docs/` directory, including `file_system_manifest.md` for structural overview.
*   The `ragit` project is a complex Rust-based system with a highly modular and layered architecture. It aims to unify code analysis, AI/LLM integration, and blockchain (Solana), using "meme" and "vibe" as core metaphors. It adheres to a "one declaration per file" principle and is actively undergoing significant refactoring. Key components include core data structures (`ragit-types`), indexing and querying (`ragit-index`, `ragit-query`), a custom Prompt Description Language (PDL), and deep philosophical/mathematical underpinnings in `ragit-core/src/grand_plan/`.
*   The `solfunmeme_ontology_vibe` crate is a new component in the Solfunmeme-Dioxus project. Its purpose is to encapsulate and manage interactions with the `sophia` RDF library, providing a simplified interface and improving modularity. It centralizes RDF-related logic and is designed to integrate RDF graph management with Dioxus rendering and Solana PDA integration. Development involves fixing `sophia` API usage errors, type mismatches, and Rust's borrowing rules.
*   Welcome, we love your creativity, but we have procedures for everything. the first procedure is to learn the procedures. the second procedure is to follow the procedures. the third procedure is improve the procedures. the 4th to share them. the 5 is profit.
*   The project's glossary of terms is located in the directory /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/ragit/docs/index/glossary_terms/.
*   The project follows ISO 9000, GMP, Six Sigma, ITIL, C4 Model, and PlantUML methodologies and standards.
*   The project's Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are located in the /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/ragit/docs/sops/ directory.
*   Code Archaeology SOP: Search for existing code before writing new code, document findings, and update the central index.
*   Drafts should be saved directly to the filesystem in the appropriate QA or SOPs directory to prevent data loss from memory crashes.
*   I must follow written proposals and use the project's change management procedures for all modifications.
*   User prefers that I do not use my built-in search tool because it crashes. A new search tool is being built.
*   The "Have a KitKat" meta-program should follow the project's QA system SOPs (and new ones should be written if needed), and adhere to ISO 9000, GMP, Six Sigma, C4 Model, UML, ITIL, HIPAA, and DevSecOps best practices.
*   The project's quality procedures include: using internal `ragit` search for code, adhering to 'one declaration per file', consistent `PathBuf` usage, proper module visibility and re-exports, implementing `From` traits for custom errors, systematic error resolution, runtime resource loading, specific error handling, and using `cargo check` vs. `cargo run` appropriately, and correct workspace binary execution.
*   The project's branching strategy SOP defines clear and consistent branching for `ragit`, including naming conventions for feature (`feature/<name>`), bugfix (`bugfix/<issue-id>-<name>`), and submodule branches (`<submodule-name>-<name>`). It outlines procedures for creating main and submodule-specific branches, committing changes within submodules, and updating the main repository's submodule references.
*   The project's dependency management SOP outlines a controlled process for managing external Rust dependencies, prioritizing vendoring or forking crates into the `vendor/` directory. It details procedures for identifying, evaluating, and integrating dependencies, including updating `Cargo.toml` with `[patch.crates-io]` entries and committing changes. Core principles include control, reproducibility, security, stability, and transparency, in compliance with ISO 9000.
*   The project's documentation management SOP outlines procedures for creating, storing, and maintaining documentation in Markdown format within the `docs/` directory, with a central index at `docs/index/index.md`. It emphasizes regular review, version control, and adherence to core principles like hierarchical search, 'one declaration per file' for documentation, vendor/fork dependencies, structured branching, and the use of meta-programs like 'KitKat' and 'GM'.
*   The DYIM Embedding Pipeline aims to transform the project's file structure into a semantic vectorspace using `ragit-dyim`. Current status involves initial dependency additions and updates to `dyim_command.rs`. Significant challenges include API incompatibilities within the vendored `sophia_rs` library and its dependencies (`resiter`, `mownstr`), leading to complex manual patching. Planned next steps focus on addressing `sophia_rs` compatibility directly within its source, identifying compatible dependency versions from `Cargo.lock`, and updating `ragit-dyim/Cargo.toml` accordingly.

## KitKat Plan (`docs/metaprogram_kitkat_plan.md`):

# KitKat Break: Project State and Next Steps

## Date: August 8, 2025

## Current State:

We have made significant progress in enhancing our codebase analysis and semantic enrichment tools.

**Key Achievements:**
- **`directory_reorganizer` crate:** Introduced a new utility for organizing files.
- **`term_report_generator` enhancements:** Improved term reporting, including memory usage and sorting by directory size.
- **`word_counter` updates:** Enhanced to exclude submodule content and specific test data.
- **`path_relationship_matrix_generator` crate:** Developed to generate a rich path relationship matrix, categorizing relationships (subdirectory, same filename) and assigning usage counts (zero, few, many, all).
- **`tree_term_reporter` crate:** Significantly enhanced to:
    - Extract terms more granularly from paths, filenames (splitting by `_`), and extensions.
    - Differentiate between "internal" (within `crates/`) and "external" terms.
    - Generate separate `tree_term_report_internal.json`, `tree_term_report_external.json`, `term_path_map_internal.json`, and `term_path_map_external.json` files, all output to `index/solfunmeme-index/`.
- **`term_quiz_master` crate:** Transformed into a robust interactive classification tool:
    - Reads from the new internal/external term reports and path maps.
    - Accepts user input for `category`, `significance`, `vibe`, and `action_suggestion` via command-line arguments.
    - Updates `augmented_terms_hot_take.json` (now located in `index/solfunmeme-index/`) with the new classifications.
- **Dependency Resolution:** Successfully navigated and resolved several complex dependency issues related to `sophia_rs` in the workspace `Cargo.toml`.
- **`pathfinder_simd` warning resolved:** Removed the unused patch entry from `Cargo.toml`.
- **Memory Profiling:** Integrated `ragit-memory-monitor` to track memory usage during `solfunmeme-metameme` operations. Initial tests show no consistent memory growth, suggesting no memory leaks in the poem generation process.
- **Instrumentation Macro:** Developed `ragit-instrumentation-macros` for basic function entry/exit logging. (Note: Advanced memory/time profiling features were reverted to avoid redundancy with `ragit-memory-monitor`).

**Current Data Files (generated and staged):**
- `path_relationship_matrix.json`
- `tree_term_report_internal.json`
- `tree_term_report_external.json`
- `term_path_map_internal.json`
- `term_path_map_external.json`
- `augmented_terms_hot_take.json` (continuously updated with classifications)

**Next Steps (After KitKat):**
1.  **Integrate Glossary and Ontology:** Develop the `semantic_term_processor` to read and integrate data from `docs/index/glossary_terms/*.md` and `ontologies/numberology.ttl` (and potentially `vendor/meta-introspector/solfunmeme-dioxus/ontologies/zos/v1.ttl` if located). This will enrich our term schema with more formal predicates.
2.  **Further Term Classification:** Continue using `term_quiz_master` to classify more terms, focusing on high-impact or frequently occurring terms.
3.  **Visualization:** Explore ways to visualize the generated term relationships and classifications.

## KitKat Time!
Take a well-deserved break. We've earned it.

    refactor: Revert solfunmeme-metameme instrumentation and cleanup
    
    This commit reverts the instrumentation changes made to the `solfunmeme-metameme` submodule and cleans up related dependencies. This is part of a broader cleanup effort to streamline profiling and avoid redundant tools.
    
    This commit also marks the beginning of a "KitKat break" to re-evaluate the profiling strategy and ensure adherence to existing quality procedures.

    refactor: Revert ragit-instrumentation-macros to basic functionality
    
    This commit reverts the `ragit-instrumentation-macros` crate to its initial state, removing the memory and time profiling features. This is part of a cleanup process to avoid redundant profiling efforts, as a more comprehensive memory profiler already exists within the `ragit` project.
    
    The macro now only prints function entry and exit messages.
