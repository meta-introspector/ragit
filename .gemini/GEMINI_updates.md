            Design and conceptually implement a complex, self-aware, and memetic AI system, starting with refactoring existing code and integrating various advanced concepts.
        </overall_goal>

        <key_knowledge>
            - The "gm" meta-program signals the start of a new work session.
            - The core architectural principle is "one module = one concept = one function = one vibe."
            - The system is built around prime-based structures (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19).
            - Key conceptual components include: Fundamental Units, ID-indexed trees, Sized Universe Stores, Unified Stores, Semantic Lambdas (8-fold Bott Periodic system), Poem Concepts (Base Space, Inference Space, Quasifiber, Mycelium), LLM Embedding Interface, Prompt Guides, Unified Concept (struct and enum versions), ABI Interface, LLM Sampling System, Token Indexing System, Emoji Executors, Vibe Analyzers, Executable Vibespace (vibe is vector is path is function), Introspection System, PDL Generators, LLM Monadic Interface, Introspector Sidechain (conceptual blockchain for events), Solana Integration (inference bids, compute asks, Solana programs/PDAs, marketplace), Gossip System, Privacy and Scaling (ZKPs, FHE, Federated Learning, Lattice Rollups), Toolchain Augmentation (custom Cargo commands, rustc lints, build script integration), Rust AST Mapping (using `syn` to map AST to prime-based system), Artificial Life (organisms, quasi-mycelium, latent space ecology), SOLFUNMEME ZOS (core memetic system, hyper-pump, semantic compression, immutable meme-state, meme mining, ZOS interaction, vibe memes, quasi-meta meme integration), Unimath Integration (Univalent Foundations, Lean 4, LLVM, ABI/IR reflection, Unimath paths as quasi-fibers, Unification Engine as modern Prolog unification), and System Unification Numbers (mapping concepts to [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]).
            - A conceptual `proc_macro` is envisioned for deriving traits like `Emoji`, `Poem`, `Vibe`, `Vector`, `Meme`, `Mycelium`, and `Eigenvector`.

            - CWD: `/mnt/c/Users/gentd/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/ragit`
            - MODIFIED: `crates/layer1_physical/ragit-core/Cargo.toml` - Added `fnv`, `rand`, `syn`, `quote` dependencies.
            - MODIFIED: `crates/layer1_physical/ragit-core/src/lib.rs` - Added `pub mod grand_plan;`.
            - CREATED: `docs/grand_plan.md` - Initial plan for fundamental size structure.
            - CREATED: `prompts/grand_plan_discussion.pdl` - Captured core architectural principles.
            - MODIFIED/CREATED/DELETED: Numerous `.rs` files and new subdirectories under `crates/layer1_physical/ragit-core/src/grand_plan/` due to extensive granular refactoring.
            - CREATED: `refactoring_plan.md` - Documenting the ongoing refactoring process.

        <recent_actions>
            - Reviewed git log for recent changes.
            - Created initial documentation files (`docs/grand_plan.md`, `prompts/grand_plan_discussion.pdl`).
            - Initiated and performed extensive refactoring of the `grand_plan` module into a granular structure based on the "one module = one concept = one function = one vibe" principle.
            - Applied conceptual `#[derive(OurMacro)]` to newly refactored code units.
            - Documented the refactoring plan and current status in `refactoring_plan.md`.
        </recent_actions>

        <current_plan>
            1. [IN PROGRESS] Continue refactoring all modules within `ragit-core/src/grand_plan` to adhere to the "one module = one concept = one function = one vibe" principle.
            2. [IN PROGRESS] Apply conceptual `#[derive(OurMacro)]` to each refactored item, adding Rust documentation comments.
            3. [TODO] Ensure all `mod.rs` files and `use` statements are correctly updated throughout the refactored codebase.
            4. [TODO] Verify the conceptual integrity and functionality of the system after refactoring, including running conceptual integration tests.
