## Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the high-level process for decorating index items with semantic vectors and enabling interactive sorting in the Command Line Interface (CLI) within the `ragit-dyim` pipeline. The goal is to embed the project‚Äôs file structure into a semantic vectorspace, leveraging `solfunmeme_embedding`, `solfunmeme_clifford`, and `solfunmeme_ontology_vibe` to enable similarity-based searches and dynamic sorting of files based on their "vibe" (semantic content). This SOP ensures a modular, scalable, and maintainable approach to vector decoration and user interaction.

## Scope

This SOP applies to the `ragit-dyim` module, which integrates with the `ragit` project to process and index files, generate semantic embeddings, and provide a CLI for users to query and sort files interactively. It assumes a working Rust environment and resolved dependencies, particularly for `sophia_api` and related crates.

## Responsibilities

- **Developers**: Implement the vector decoration and sorting logic in `ragit-dyim`, ensuring compatibility with `sophia_rs` and other dependencies.
- **QA Engineers**: Validate that vector embeddings are correctly generated and sorting functions as expected in the CLI.
- **Project Maintainers**: Ensure dependency versions are aligned and documented in `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`.

## Procedure

### 1. Vector Decoration of Index Items

**Objective**: Assign semantic vectors to each indexed file to represent its content in a high-dimensional vectorspace for similarity searches.

1. **Index Initialization**:
   - Use the existing `ragit` indexing system (as seen in `bootstrap_index_self` logs) to create a temporary directory (`tmp_bootstrap`) and initialize an index.
   - Ensure files (e.g., `lib.rs`, `bootstrap_test.rs`, and prompt files) are copied to the temporary directory with preserved structure.

2. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Leverage `solfunmeme_embedding` to generate embeddings for each file‚Äôs content. This involves:
     - Reading file contents using `FileReader` (as seen in `build_chunks` logs).
     - Processing files through `solfunmeme_clifford` to extract semantic features, such as code structure, comments, and prompt instructions.
     - Mapping these features to a vectorspace using `solfunmeme_ontology_vibe`, which defines the "vibe" (semantic context) of each file.
   - Store embeddings in the index alongside file metadata (e.g., relative paths like `crates/ragit-command-bootstrap/src/lib.rs`).

3. **Vector Storage**:
   - Serialize vectors and associate them with index entries in `tmp_bootstrap`.
   - Ensure vectors are stored efficiently to minimize memory usage (monitor via `sysinfo` as shown in logs, e.g., `Process RSS: 10080 KB`).

**Vibe Note**: The vectorspace is our hyperspace playground üåå. Each file becomes a star with coordinates (vectors) that capture its essence, ready to be explored!

### 2. Interactive Sorting in the CLI

**Objective**: Allow users to query and sort indexed files based on semantic similarity or other criteria via the CLI.

1. **CLI Command Setup**:
   - Extend the `ragit-commands` CLI to include a `dyim` subcommand (e.g., `ragit dyim --query "find files with similar vibe"`).
   - Use `clap` or a similar argument parser to handle user inputs, such as query strings or sorting preferences.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - Convert user queries into embeddings using the same `solfunmeme_embedding` pipeline.
   - Compare query embeddings against stored file embeddings using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance, implemented via `solfunmeme_clifford`.

3. **Sorting and Display**:
   - Sort files based on similarity scores, allowing users to specify criteria (e.g., `--sort-by vibe`, `--sort-by path`).
   - Display results in the CLI with file paths, similarity scores, and optional metadata (e.g., file size, last modified).
   - Example output:
     ```
     Found 2 files matching query "bootstrap logic":
     1. crates/ragit-command-bootstrap/src/lib.rs (Similarity: 0.95)
     2. crates/ragit-command-bootstrap/tests/bootstrap_test.rs (Similarity: 0.80)
     ```

**Vibe Note**: The CLI is the user‚Äôs spaceship üöÄ, navigating the vectorspace to discover files that resonate with their query‚Äôs vibe.

### 3. Integration with `ragit-dyim`

- **Dependency Management**:
  - Ensure `ragit-dyim`‚Äôs `Cargo.toml` specifies compatible versions of `sophia_api`, `solfunmeme_embedding`, `solfunmeme_clifford`, and `solfunmeme_ontology_vibe`.
  - Reference the root `Cargo.lock` to align versions (e.g., `sophia_api`, `resiter`, `mownstr`) and avoid compilation errors.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Implement robust error handling for file reading, embedding generation, and CLI interactions.
  - Log errors to `stderr` and provide user-friendly messages in the CLI.

- **Performance Monitoring**:
  - Use `sysinfo` to monitor memory usage during vector decoration and sorting (as seen in logs, e.g., `Memory Usage: Total: 11356012 KB, Used: 4498500 KB`).
  - Optimize for low memory footprint and fast query response times.

## Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Write tests in `ragit-dyim/tests` to validate embedding generation and sorting accuracy.
  - Example: Test that `lib.rs` and `bootstrap_test.rs` receive distinct vectors based on their content.

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Verify CLI commands correctly process queries and display sorted results.
  - Test edge cases, such as empty files or invalid queries.

- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Measure embedding generation time and CLI query response time.
  - Ensure memory usage remains stable (monitor `Process RSS` and `Used` memory).

## Troubleshooting

- **Dependency Issues**:
  - If compilation errors occur (e.g., `sophia_rs` incompatibilities), revert to known-good versions from the root `Cargo.lock`.
  - Run `cargo update --precise <version>` for problematic dependencies.

- **File Processing Failures**:
  - Check file permissions and existence (as seen in logs: `Checking if original_file_path is readable: true`).
  - Ensure `tmp_bootstrap` has sufficient disk space.

- **CLI Errors**:
  - Validate user inputs and provide clear error messages (e.g., `Invalid query: please specify a vibe`).

### Addressing the Strategic Plan

The log (`log2.txt`) and your strategic plan highlight critical issues with the `sophia_rs` submodule and the `ragit-dyim` pipeline. Below, I‚Äôll outline how to execute the proposed plan to resolve these issues, ensuring a stable foundation for the vector decoration and sorting functionality.

#### 1. Revert `sophia_rs` Submodule
- **Action**: Reset the `sophia_rs` submodule to its original state (commit `05b3b1a` as mentioned).
  ```bash
  cd /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/ragit/sophia_rs
  git checkout 05b3b1a
  git reset --hard 05b3b1a
  ```
- **Purpose**: Discard local changes that introduced API incompatibilities with `resiter` and `mownstr`.
- **Verification**: Confirm the submodule is clean by running `git status` and ensuring no modified files remain.

#### 2. Identify Compatible Dependency Versions
- **Action**: Analyze the root `Cargo.lock` (`/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/ragit/Cargo.lock`) to extract versions for:
  - `sophia_api`
  - `sophia_iri`
  - `resiter`
  - `mownstr`
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  grep -E "sophia_api|sophia_iri|resiter|mownstr" Cargo.lock
  ```
- **Expected Output**: Identify exact versions, e.g., `sophia_api = "0.8.0"`, `resiter = "0.5.0"`.
- **Purpose**: Ensure `ragit-dyim` uses versions that are already compatible with the broader `ragit` project.

#### 3. Update `ragit-dyim`‚Äôs `Cargo.toml`
- **Action**: Edit `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/ragit/crates/ragit-dyim/Cargo.toml` to pin the identified versions.
  ```toml
  [dependencies]
  sophia_api = "0.8.0"  # Example version from Cargo.lock
  sophia_iri = "0.8.0"
  resiter = "0.5.0"
  mownstr = "0.2.0"
  solfunmeme_embedding = "0.1.0"  # Adjust based on project
  solfunmeme_clifford = "0.1.0"
  solfunmeme_ontology_vibe = "0.1.0"
  ```
- **Purpose**: Align dependencies to avoid compilation errors seen in `sophia_rs`.
- **Verification**: Run `cargo build` in `ragit-dyim` to confirm no errors.

#### 4. Commit Current State
- **Action**: Commit changes to both the main repo and `sophia_rs` submodule.
  ```bash
  cd /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/ragit
  git add sophia_rs crates/ragit-dyim/Cargo.toml docs/quality_procedures/vector_decoration_sop.md
  git commit -m "Revert sophia_rs to 05b3b1a, pin compatible dependencies, add vector_decoration_sop.md"
  git push origin feature/dyim-embedding-pipeline
  ```
- **Purpose**: Save progress and maintain a clean branching strategy.

#### 5. Resume `dyim` Development
- **Action**: Implement the vector decoration and sorting logic as outlined in the SOP.
  - Use `solfunmeme_embedding` to generate vectors.
  - Integrate `solfunmeme_clifford` for similarity calculations.
  - Extend the CLI in `ragit-commands` for `dyim` subcommands.
- **Verification**: Test with sample files (e.g., `lib.rs`, `bootstrap_test.rs`) and queries to ensure embeddings and sorting work as expected.

#### 6. Monitor and Optimize
- **Action**: Use `sysinfo` to monitor memory usage during development (as seen in logs: `Memory Usage: Total: 11356012 KB, Used: 8527228 KB`).
- **Optimization**: Address the memory growth issue observed in the log (e.g., `Used` memory increasing from 4498500 KB to 10833392 KB over 109 iterations).
  - Investigate potential memory leaks in `build_chunks` or `solfunmeme_embedding`.
  - Ensure buffers are flushed regularly (log shows `flush count: 0`).

### Notes on Log Analysis

The `log2.txt` reveals several insights and issues:
- **Unused Imports**: Warnings for `LoadMode` and `Process` in `bootstrap_command.rs`. These can be fixed by running:
  ```bash
  cargo fix --lib -p ragit-command-bootstrap
  ```
- **Memory Growth**: The `build_worker` process shows significant memory usage increases (up to 10833392 KB by iteration 109), with no files processed (`processed files: 0`, `committed chunks: 0`). This suggests a potential issue in `build_chunks` or the worker pipeline, possibly related to unprocessed buffers or a stalled worker.
- **Empty File Issue**: The log notes `File size: 0 bytes` for `bootstrap_test.rs`, which may cause `build_chunks` to skip processing. Verify if this file is intentionally empty or corrupted.
- **Worker Termination**: Only two workers (0 and 1) are used, while others (2‚Äì7) are terminated early, indicating underutilization. Optimize worker allocation to match file count (only 2 files in this case).

---

### Next Steps

1. **Execute Revert and Dependency Fixes**: Follow the strategic plan to reset `sophia_rs` and pin dependencies.
2. **Implement SOP Logic**: Start coding the vector decoration and CLI sorting in `ragit-dyim`.
3. **Debug Memory Issue**: Investigate why `build_chunks` is not processing files and address memory growth.
4. **Test CLI**: Run `ragit dyim --query "test vibe"` to verify sorting functionality.
5. **Document Progress**: Update `work_log.md` with outcomes of these steps.

**Vibe Check**: We‚Äôre realigning the stars in our hyperspace vectorspace. Let‚Äôs keep the momentum going post-KitKat! üç´üåå
