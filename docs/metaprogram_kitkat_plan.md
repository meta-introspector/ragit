# Meta-Program: Have a KitKat (2025-07-26)

This document outlines the next critical path for the RAGIT project, established after a "kitkat" meta-program cycle.

## New Critical Path: Achieving True Self-Improvement

The `bootstrap_index_self` function is now technically operational and has made significant progress towards a real self-improvement loop.

### 1. Implement Core Functions (Progress)

We have made progress in replacing placeholder logic in the core indexing and querying pipeline:

- **`add_files_command`:** The `bootstrap_index_self` function now dynamically identifies and adds all files from its own crate to the index using `CargoPackageFileSource`.
- **`index.build`:** The build process is integrated, and the function now successfully generates chunks.
- **`index.query`:** This function is currently using a test model. The next step is to connect it to a real LLM backend (e.g., via the `ragit-api` crate). The function must be able to take a text prompt, send it to the configured LLM, and return the response.

### 2. Execute and Refine the Self-Improvement Loop (Progress)

With the core functions showing progress, we have refined the self-improvement loop:

- **Execute:** The `bootstrap_index_self` command can now be executed in a controlled test environment.
- **Debug:** We have successfully debugged and resolved issues related to file paths, dependencies, and module visibility.
    - The bootstrap command's own source code is correctly read and chunked.
    - The index is built successfully.
    - **New:** Chunks are now written to `chunks_output.md` for inspection and QA.
    - The self-improvement prompt is sent to the LLM (test model).
    - The LLM's response (from the test model) is handled.
    - The `write_string` operation successfully overwrites the source file with the improved code (from the test model).
- **Goal:** The primary objective is to achieve a state where the `bootstrap_index_self` function can successfully and meaningfully modify its own source code in a single, automated run, using a *real* LLM.

### 3. Documentation and Reflection

Once the self-improvement loop is fully functional, it needs to be properly documented.

- **Command Documentation:** Update `docs/commands/bootstrap.md` to reflect the command's new, powerful self-improvement capability.
- **Project README:** Add a section to the main `README.md` or a core architecture document explaining this unique feature of the RAGIT system. This is a key differentiator and should be highlighted.
