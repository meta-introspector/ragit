# KitKat Break: Project State and Next Steps

## Date: August 8, 2025

## Current State:

We have made significant progress in enhancing our codebase analysis and semantic enrichment tools.

**Key Achievements:**
- **`directory_reorganizer` crate:** Introduced a new utility for organizing files.
- **`term_report_generator` enhancements:** Improved term reporting, including memory usage and sorting by directory size.
- **`word_counter` updates:** Enhanced to exclude submodule content and specific test data.
- **`path_relationship_matrix_generator` crate:** Developed to generate a rich path relationship matrix, categorizing relationships (subdirectory, same filename) and assigning usage counts (zero, few, many, all).
- **`tree_term_reporter` crate:** Significantly enhanced to:
    - Extract terms more granularly from paths, filenames (splitting by `_`), and extensions.
    - Differentiate between "internal" (within `crates/`) and "external" terms.
    - Generate separate `tree_term_report_internal.json`, `tree_term_report_external.json`, `term_path_map_internal.json`, and `term_path_map_external.json` files, all output to `index/solfunmeme-index/`.
- **`term_quiz_master` crate:** Transformed into a robust interactive classification tool:
    - Reads from the new internal/external term reports and path maps.
    - Accepts user input for `category`, `significance`, `vibe`, and `action_suggestion` via command-line arguments.
    - Updates `augmented_terms_hot_take.json` (now located in `index/solfunmeme-index/`) with the new classifications.
- **Dependency Resolution:** Successfully navigated and resolved several complex dependency issues related to `sophia_rs` in the workspace `Cargo.toml`.
- **`pathfinder_simd` warning resolved:** Removed the unused patch entry from `Cargo.toml`.
- **Memory Profiling:** Integrated `ragit-memory-monitor` to track memory usage during `solfunmeme-metameme` operations. Initial tests show no consistent memory growth, suggesting no memory leaks in the poem generation process.
- **Instrumentation Macro:** Developed `ragit-instrumentation-macros` for basic function entry/exit logging. (Note: Advanced memory/time profiling features were reverted to avoid redundancy with `ragit-memory-monitor`).

**Current Data Files (generated and staged):**
- `path_relationship_matrix.json`
- `tree_term_report_internal.json`
- `tree_term_report_external.json`
- `term_path_map_internal.json`
- `term_path_map_external.json`
- `augmented_terms_hot_take.json` (continuously updated with classifications)

**Next Steps (After KitKat):**
1.  **Integrate Glossary and Ontology:** Develop the `semantic_term_processor` to read and integrate data from `docs/index/glossary_terms/*.md` and `ontologies/numberology.ttl` (and potentially `vendor/meta-introspector/solfunmeme-dioxus/ontologies/zos/v1.ttl` if located). This will enrich our term schema with more formal predicates.
2.  **Further Term Classification:** Continue using `term_quiz_master` to classify more terms, focusing on high-impact or frequently occurring terms.
3.  **Visualization:** Explore ways to visualize the generated term relationships and classifications.

## KitKat Time!
Take a well-deserved break. We've earned it.
