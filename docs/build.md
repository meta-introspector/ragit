# Build

## cargo

If you have [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) installed, just run `cargo install ragit`.

## install from source

### Dependencies

- ubuntu: `sudo apt install clang libssl-dev libfontconfig1-dev make unzip`
- redhat: `sudo dnf install clang openssl-devel fontconfig-devel unzip`

These are dependencies needed when all the features are enabled. By default, most features are disabled and you don't need all of them.

### Compile

```
git clone https://github.com/baehyunsol/ragit
```

```
cd ragit
```

You need [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) anyway to compile the source. `cargo` is the only dependency. Make sure that your rust-toolchain is up to date. Ragit doesn't have an MSRV policy. It's always tested on the newest version of rust and is likely to fail on 1.84 or older versions.

Ragit is built with a modular, multi-crate architecture. While the internal structure is composed of many specialized crates, `cargo` automatically manages their compilation and dependencies. You can build the entire project using the standard `cargo build` commands:

```
# only default features
cargo build --release

# enable all features
cargo build --release --features=full
```

### Building mupdf-rs

If you enable `pdf` feature, it depends on [mupdf-rs](https://github.com/messense/mupdf-rs).

On apple silicon, you have to add below lines to `Cargo.toml`. It's already added to ragit. If you want to use ragit as library, you have to add it manually.

```toml
[patch.crates-io]
pathfinder_simd = { git = "https://github.com/servo/pathfinder.git" }
```

## Test scripts

If you have Python, test your build with test scripts.

```
python scripts/tests.py all
```
