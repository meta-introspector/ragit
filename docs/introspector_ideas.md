# Introspector and Tooling Ideas

This document contains ideas for improving the development tools and introspection capabilities of the `ragit` project.

## 1. `log_verbose!` Macro for MemoryMonitor

To simplify verbose logging and avoid repeated `if verbose` checks, we could create a `log_verbose!` macro.

### Problem

Currently, the code is sprinkled with blocks like:

```rust
if verbose {
    println!("Some debug message: {} {}", var1, var2);
}
```

And we are refactoring it to:

```rust
memory_monitor.verbose(&format!("Some debug message: {} {}", var1, var2));
```

This is better because it centralizes the check, but the `format!` call still happens every time, even if verbose logging is disabled. This is an unnecessary performance cost.

### Proposed Solution

A `log_verbose!` macro would solve this cleanly and efficiently.

```rust
// In the MemoryMonitor's crate
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! log_verbose {
    ($monitor:expr, $($arg:tt)*) => {
        if $monitor.is_verbose() {
            println!($($arg)*);
        }
    };
}
```

And it would be used like this:

```rust
log_verbose!(memory_monitor, "Some debug message: {} {}", var1, var2);
```

### Advantages

*   **Ergonomics:** The call site is as clean as a `println!`. No more `format!` boilerplate.
*   **Performance:** The arguments to the macro (including the variables `var1`, `var2`) are not evaluated unless the `if` condition (`$monitor.is_verbose()`) is true. This avoids the cost of formatting the string when logging is disabled.
*   **Flexibility:** It leverages the existing `println!` macro's ability to handle any number of arguments of any type.

This would require adding a simple `is_verbose(&self) -> bool` method to the `MemoryMonitor`.
