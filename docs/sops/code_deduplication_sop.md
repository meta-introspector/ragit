# SOP: Code Deduplication and Refactoring

## 1. Purpose
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the process for identifying and reducing duplicate code within the `ragit` project to improve maintainability, readability, and overall code quality.

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to all Rust source code (`*.rs`), Markdown documentation (`*.md`), and TOML configuration files (`*.toml`) within the `ragit` project repository.

## 3. Procedure

### Phase 1: Universal Ingestion
**Objective:** To ingest all relevant project files into a dedicated `ragit` knowledge base, breaking them down into content-addressed chunks.

**Steps:**
1.  Ensure `ragit` is installed and configured.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the `ragit` project.
3.  Execute the following commands to ingest the entire repository:
    ```bash
    ragit add .
    ragit build
    ```

**Expected Outcome:** All specified files are processed and stored as content-addressed chunks within the `ragit` index.

### Phase 2: Topological Analysis
**Objective:** To create a machine-readable dependency graph of the codebase, understanding how different code chunks relate to each other.

**Steps:**
1.  Develop or utilize an existing `ragit` analysis tool (e.g., a new `ragit` command or a Rust binary within the `ragit` ecosystem).
2.  This tool should:
    *   Iterate through all Rust code chunks identified in Phase 1.
    *   Use the `syn` crate to parse Rust code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
    *   Walk the AST to identify all symbols (function calls, struct names, traits) used by each chunk.
    *   Query the `ragit` index to find the chunks where these symbols are defined.
    *   Construct and store a dependency graph, mapping each chunk to its dependencies.

**Expected Outcome:** A comprehensive dependency graph of the `ragit` codebase is generated and stored as metadata within the `ragit` index.

### Phase 3: Deduplication and Refactoring Insights
**Objective:** To leverage the ingested data and dependency graph to identify refactoring opportunities and generate a prioritized list of duplicate code blocks.

**Steps:**
1.  **Identify Exact Duplicates:** Query the `ragit` index for chunks with identical UIDs (content hashes).
2.  **Identify Topological Duplicates:** Analyze the dependency graph to find chunks with identical or near-identical dependency lists, indicating functionally similar but potentially differently named code.
3.  **Identify Semantic + Topological Duplicates:** Combine vector search (using existing embeddings) with graph analysis to find code blocks that are semantically similar and share common dependencies.
4.  Prioritize the identified duplicate code blocks based on factors such as:
    *   Frequency of duplication.
    *   Complexity of the duplicated code.
    *   Impact of refactoring (e.g., how many other modules would benefit).

**Expected Outcome:** A prioritized list of refactoring candidates is generated, enabling systematic removal of redundancy and improvement of code quality.

## 4. Tools
*   `ragit` CLI (for `add` and `build` commands)
*   Rust programming language
*   `syn` crate (for Rust AST parsing)
*   Custom `ragit` analysis tool (to be developed or identified)

## 5. Expected Outcome
*   Reduced code redundancy within the `ragit` project.
*   Improved code maintainability and readability.
*   A clearer understanding of the codebase's structure and dependencies.
*   Enhanced overall code quality and reduced technical debt.
