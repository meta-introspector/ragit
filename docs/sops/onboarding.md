# Onboarding for New Users

Welcome to the team! To get started with the Gemini CLI and understand our workflow, please follow these steps:

1.  **Install the Gemini CLI:**
    Open your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
    ```

2.  **Daily Workflow Acronyms:**
    Once the CLI is set up, you'll frequently encounter these acronyms in our daily workflow:

    *   **GM (Good Morning):** This signifies the start of your day. It means to review our documentation and then our git history to get up to speed and continue your work.
    *   **WB (Welcome Back):** This is a greeting used when returning to work or a task.
    *   **LG (Let's Go):** This is a motivational phrase, short for "LFG" without the "F," indicating readiness to proceed or start a task with enthusiasm.

3.  **Review Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):**
    It is crucial to familiarize yourself with our Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) located in the `docs/sops/` directory. These documents outline our established processes and best practices.
