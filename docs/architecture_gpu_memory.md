# Architecture: GPU-Accelerated Real-Time Associative Memory

This document outlines a forward-looking architecture for a system that stores `ragit` memories (chunks, vectors, "vibes") directly in GPU memory for real-time comparison and action during LLM inference.

## Core Concept

The central idea is to create a **GPU-native associative memory**. Instead of retrieving relevant chunks from a database before sending a prompt to an LLM, we load the entire vector space of the knowledge base into the GPU's VRAM. 

During the LLM's token generation process, the system performs continuous, massively parallel similarity searches between the LLM's current internal state (represented as a vector) and the millions of vectors stored in VRAM.

This transforms the LLM from a simple generator into a **reactive agent** that can be influenced and trigger actions in real-time based on its own train of thought.

## Key Components

1.  **GPU Memory Store:**
    *   A dedicated data structure, optimized for GPU hardware, that holds the entire vector space of a `ragit` knowledge base.
    *   This requires efficient memory management to load, unload, and update vector sets in VRAM.

2.  **Real-Time Similarity Search Engine:**
    *   A highly optimized kernel (e.g., written in CUDA or ROCm) that continuously calculates the distance (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) between the LLM's current state vector and all vectors in the GPU memory store.

3.  **Trigger & Action System:**
    *   A user-programmable system for defining rules and actions.
    *   **Trigger Condition:** A rule is defined by a similarity threshold (the "epsilon error rate"). When the distance between the LLM's state and a stored vector falls below this epsilon, the trigger fires.
    *   **Action:** The corresponding action is executed. This could be anything from injecting text into the LLM's context, calling an external API, or even modifying the `ragit` knowledge base itself.

## Example Workflow

1.  A `ragit` knowledge base is loaded into the GPU memory store.
2.  A user starts a conversation with the LLM.
3.  As the LLM generates a response, token by token, its internal state is vectorized.
4.  With each new token, the similarity search engine compares this state vector against all vectors in the GPU.
5.  The engine finds that the LLM's current thought process is very close (within epsilon) to a vector representing a specific technical concept, e.g., "libp2p swarm initialization."
6.  This fires a pre-programmed trigger.
7.  The trigger's action is to fetch a relevant code snippet from the `ragit` chunk associated with that vector and inject it directly into the LLM's immediate context.
8.  The LLM seamlessly incorporates the code snippet into its response, providing a more accurate and detailed answer.

## Advantages

*   **Unprecedented Reactivity:** The AI can react to its own thoughts in microseconds.
*   **Dynamic Context Injection:** Context is provided exactly when it's needed, not just at the beginning of a prompt.
*   **Emergent Behavior:** Complex, goal-oriented behaviors can emerge from simple, low-level trigger rules.

## Challenges

*   **Hardware Dependency:** Requires powerful GPUs with significant VRAM.
*   **Systems Programming:** Demands deep expertise in GPU programming (CUDA/ROCm) and systems-level integration with LLM inference engines.
*   **Concurrency:** Managing the interaction between the LLM, the search engine, and the action triggers is a complex concurrency challenge.
