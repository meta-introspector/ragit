# RAGIT Onboarding: Welcome to the Meme Mine!

## Slide 1: Title Slide

*   **Title:** Welcome, N00bs! Your Journey into the RAGITverse Begins!
*   **Subtitle:** Building the Future of Knowledge with Memes, Code, and Rust.
*   **Image:** A stylized RAGIT logo (conceptual), perhaps with a subtle ASCII art fungus or a "meme" emoji.
*   **Presenter:** [Your Name/Team Lead Name]
*   **Date:** August 4, 2025

## Slide 2: Welcome to the Team!

*   **Who are we?** The RAGIT Core Development Team.
*   **What is RAGIT?** A revolutionary `git`-like software that transforms local files into intelligent, shareable knowledge bases.
*   **Why are you here?** To contribute to a cutting-edge project, learn Rust, blockchain, AI, and formal verification, and help us "eat our own dogfood"!

## Slide 3: RAGIT's Core Concepts: Beyond Just Code

*   **RAGIT: A Git-like RAG Pipeline**
    *   `rag init; rag add --all; rag build; rag query "What makes ragit special?";`
    *   It's about managing knowledge, not just code.
*   **Why RAGIT is Different:**
    *   **Intelligent Chunking:** Every piece of knowledge gets a title and summary (AI-generated!).
    *   **TF-IDF Search:** We use keyword-driven search, not just vector embeddings.
    *   **Markdown & Images:** Rich content support.
    *   **Multi-Turn Queries:** Experimental conversational AI.
    *   **Clone/Push Knowledge Bases:** Just like Git, but for knowledge!
*   **The "Meme" Concept:**
    *   Not just internet jokes! In RAGIT, a "meme" is a unit of **semantic resonance** – a vector, a vibe, a glyph.
    *   It bridges formal (code, math) and intuitive (emoji) understanding.
    *   Think of emojis as data for AI to interpret, each with an 8D location (our simulated embedding!).
*   **The "Vibe":** Every function, every emoji, every basic block has a unique "vibe" – a numerical address, a random seed for future AI interpretation.

## Slide 4: Our Philosophy & Culture: How We Roll

*   **"Eat Your Own Dogfood":** We use RAGIT to understand and improve RAGIT. If it doesn't work for us, it won't work for anyone else!
*   **"One Declaration Per File":** Our golden rule for modularity. Every struct, enum, function gets its own file. Why? Universal composability, reusability, clarity, and easier refactoring.
*   **"Whistle While You Work" (Meme Mining):** We're constantly looking for patterns, connections, and ways to add value to the system. Every idea is a gem for the "hyperspace lattice."
*   **"If you can't fix it, don't break it."** (Self-explanatory, but crucial!)
*   **"Don't edit, rewrite and split."** Each edit is a chance to refactor and improve.
*   **"Always use prelude. Do not replace prelude."** Consistency in imports is key.

## Slide 5: Architectural Principles: Building Blocks of RAGIT

*   **Layered Architecture (OSI Model Analogy):**
    *   We structure our crates into conceptual layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application, Web).
    *   This promotes clear separation of concerns and reduces complexity.
*   **Prime Number Modularity:**
    *   We map our modularity to prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 19...).
    *   **2:** A function and its test, input/output.
    *   **3:** Core data structure, primary logic, I/O.
    *   **5:** A crate's main functional areas (e.g., `path_utils`, `string_utils`).
    *   **7:** Major functional areas (e.g., Indexing, Querying).
    *   **19:** The entire iterative development lifecycle.
    *   This is a conceptual framework for thinking about system decomposition.
*   **Loose Coupling through Preludes & Wildcard Imports:**
    *   We use `prelude` modules and `use *` to simplify imports and make refactoring less disruptive.

## Slide 6: Our Development Workflow & Tools

*   **Language of Choice: Rust!**
    *   Performance, safety, concurrency. Get ready to embrace the borrow checker!
*   **Cargo:** Rust's build system and package manager.
    *   `cargo build`, `cargo check`, `cargo test`.
*   **Git:** Our version control system.
    *   Branching, committing, pull requests.
    *   **Commit Messages:** Clear, concise, and focused on "why" (not just "what"). We prefer messages from files (`git commit -F temp_commit_message.txt`).
*   **The Gemini CLI (That's Me!):** Your interactive agent for coding tasks. I'm here to help you navigate the codebase, run commands, and learn.
*   **`ragit bootstrap`:** Our self-improving command. It builds an index of the codebase for `ragit` to "understand" itself.
*   **`ragit search`:** Our internal search tool. We use it instead of external tools to search our own codebase. (Dogfooding in action!)
*   **Duplicate Block Finder (Conceptual):** A future tool to identify and remove redundant code.
*   **Advanced Tech Stack (High-Level):**
    *   **eBPF & Solana Sealevel:** For high-performance, on-chain operations and our funding model.
    *   **ASM & LLVM:** For extreme optimization of critical code paths.
    *   **Lean4:** For formal verification of critical components, ensuring mathematical correctness.
    *   **Solana Meme Accounts:** Each project, each meme, is a Solana account for transparent funding and cost tracking.

## Slide 7: Getting Started: Your First Steps

1.  **Development Environment Setup:**
    *   Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed.
    *   Clone the RAGIT repository: `git clone [repo_url]`
2.  **Initial Build & Check:**
    *   Navigate to the project root: `cd ragit`
    *   Run a quick check: `cargo check --workspace`
    *   Build the project: `cargo build --workspace` (This might take a while the first time!)
3.  **Run Tests:**
    *   `cargo test --workspace`
4.  **Explore the Docs:**
    *   Dive into the `docs/` directory. Start with `docs/index/index.md` and `docs/braindump.md`.
5.  **Your First Task Ideas:**
    *   Fix a small warning (we have a few!).
    *   Explore a specific module or crate that interests you.
    *   Try running `ragit bootstrap` (with `--verbose`!).
    *   Ask me (Gemini) to search for something in the codebase using `ragit search`.

## Slide 8: Important Meta-Programs: Our Internal Playbook

*   **"Have a KitKat":**
    *   When you're stuck, overwhelmed, or need a fresh start.
    *   **Pause:** Step away from the code.
    *   **Plan:** Define a new strategic plan.
    *   **Document:** Write it down (e.g., in `metaprogram_kitkat_plan.md`).
    *   **Commit:** Commit your current state.
    *   **Reboot:** Start fresh with the new plan.
*   **"GM" (Good Morning):**
    *   How to recover from a "reboot" or when you're picking up work.
    *   Stay on the critical path.
    *   Review your memories (or my `GEMINI.md` context).
    *   Check recent commits (`git log --patch -3 --all`) to quickly understand the project's current state.

## Slide 9: Expectations & Support

*   **Learning Curve:** Rust, Solana, AI, formal verification – it's a lot! Embrace the challenge, it's incredibly rewarding.
*   **Ask Questions!** There are no "dumb" questions. We're here to help you learn and succeed.
*   **Collaboration:** We work as a team. Communicate, share ideas, and help each other.
*   **Resources:** Extensive documentation, experienced mentors, and me (Gemini) are always available.
*   **Your Contributions Matter:** Even small changes can have a big impact.
