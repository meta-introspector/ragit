# Bootstrap Self-Improvement Review

This document outlines a plan for improving the self-improvement capabilities of the `ragit bootstrap` command.

## Current Implementation

The current self-improvement process is a linear, one-shot attempt. It performs the following steps:

1.  `log_start`: Logs the start of the self-improvement query.
2.  `get_self_code`: Retrieves the source code of the `ragit-command-bootstrap` crate.
3.  `format_prompt`: Formats the source code into a prompt for the language model.
4.  `execute_query`: Sends the prompt to the language model and receives the improved code.
5.  `handle_improved_code`: Writes the improved code to a file.

This process is not truly recursive and lacks the necessary instrumentation to properly evaluate its effectiveness.

## Proposed Improvements

To address these limitations, we will refactor the `perform_self_improvement` function to be more recursive and to track key metrics. The following is a high-level plan for this refactoring:

1.  **Introduce a Loop:** The existing logic will be wrapped in a loop that iterates a specified number of times (e.g., `max_iterations`).
2.  **Track Key Metrics:** We will track the following metrics before and after each iteration:
    *   **Number of Self-Improvement Iterations:** The current iteration number.
    *   **Code Complexity:** We will use a tool like `tokei` to measure the code complexity (lines of code, cyclomatic complexity).
    *   **Performance:** We will measure the execution time of the `bootstrap` command.
    *   **LLM Response Quality:** We will manually evaluate the quality of the improved code generated by the model.
3.  **Compile and Test:** After each iteration, we will compile the new code and run the project's tests to ensure that the self-improvement process has not introduced any regressions.

This approach will provide a much better understanding of whether the self-improvement process is actually working and will allow us to track its progress over time.
