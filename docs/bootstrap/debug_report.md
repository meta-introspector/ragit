# Debug Report: `ragit bootstrap-new` Chunking Issue

## Status

As of July 29, 2025, the `ragit bootstrap-new` command executes successfully without compilation errors. However, the core functionality of chunking and writing content-addressable objects is not yet working as intended.

## Findings

Through verbose logging and step-by-step debugging, we have identified the following:

1.  **Correct Entry Point**: The `ragit bootstrap-new` command correctly executes the `ragit-build-index-worker-single-file` binary, and the `bootstrap_index_self` function is the main entry point.
2.  **`export_chunks_main` Call**: The `export_chunks_main::write_chunks_to_markdown` function is indeed being called, and it receives the `index` and `temp_dir` as expected.
3.  **Empty `index.chunks`**: The primary issue is that the `index.chunks` vector remains empty after the `build_index` step. This is confirmed by the debug output `DEBUG: Number of chunks to process: 0` in `export_chunks_main.rs`.
4.  **`TextSplitter` Malfunction**: The root cause of the empty `index.chunks` lies within `crates/layer7_application/commands/ragit-command-bootstrap/src/bootstrap_commands/build_index_logic/main_build_index.rs`. Despite files being staged and their content being read (confirmed by `DEBUG: Number of staged files: 5` and `DEBUG: Content of file ...`), the `TextSplitter` is not generating any chunks.
    *   The debug output `DEBUG: Number of chunks generated by splitter: 0` is consistently observed.
    *   The `build_config.chunk_size` is correctly set to 256 (confirmed by `DEBUG: Chunk size: 256`).
    *   The problem is in the usage of `TextSplitter::new(Characters)` and its `chunks` method. The `chunks` method still requires the `max_characters` argument, even when `Characters` is used as the `ChunkValidator` in `TextSplitter::new`.

## Next Steps

1.  **Correct `TextSplitter` Usage**: Modify `crates/layer7_application/commands/ragit-command-bootstrap/src/bootstrap_commands/build_index_logic/main_build_index.rs` to correctly use the `TextSplitter` by passing `build_config.chunk_size` to the `chunks` method.
2.  **Verify Chunk Generation**: Re-run the `bootstrap-new` command with verbose output and `--disable-cleanup` to confirm that chunks are now being generated and added to the index.
3.  **Verify Object Writing**: Confirm that the `.ragit/objects` directory and its content-addressable files are being created as expected.
