# Bootstrap Command Execution Report - Attempt 1

## Objective
To understand the initial behavior of the `ragit bootstrap` command, specifically its memory consumption and execution flow, using a limited iteration count and memory cap.

## Command Executed

```bash
cargo run --package ragit-commands -- bootstrap --max-iterations 1 --max-memory-gb 1 --verbose
```

## Observed Output

### Stdout (Truncated for brevity, key lines included)

### Exit Code
`137`

## Analysis of Findings

The `bootstrap` command successfully initiated its workflow, including setting up a temporary environment, copying prompts, and identifying source files for indexing. The `--max-iterations 1` flag was correctly honored, causing the build process to attempt a graceful exit after the first iteration.

However, the process was terminated by the operating system with an `Exit Code 137`, accompanied by a `Killed` message in `stderr`. This exit code typically signifies that the process was terminated by a `SIGKILL` signal, most commonly due to the system's Out-Of-Memory (OOM) killer.

Despite the `Process RSS` (Resident Set Size) reported in the verbose logs remaining relatively low (around 10MB), the `Killed` signal strongly suggests that the process exceeded the 1GB memory limit imposed by the `--max-memory-gb 1` flag. The discrepancy between the reported RSS and the OOM kill indicates that the memory monitoring might not be capturing the full memory footprint of the process, or that other system-level memory pressures contributed to the termination.

Attempting to enable a full Rust backtrace (`RUST_BACKTRACE=full`) did not yield additional debugging information, as the process was externally terminated by the OS before it could panic and generate a Rust-specific stack trace.

## Conclusion

The `ragit bootstrap` command is encountering a memory limitation, leading to its termination by the operating system. The current memory monitoring within the application might not be fully representative of the actual memory consumption that triggers the OS's OOM killer. Further investigation into the memory usage patterns or increasing the allocated memory limit is required to allow the bootstrap process to complete successfully.
