# Submodule: `vendor/meta-introspector/bootstrap`

This submodule implements a "Bootstrap Microkernel," a self-contained system designed to integrate mathematical frameworks with semantic processing. Its core philosophy is that "The message is the vibe is the function, the functions vibe with each other," aiming to create a self-aware and evolving codebase.

## Recent Commit History

### Branch: `master`
*   **Commit (7cb0a53dd1):** `Create rust.yml`
    *   Adds a GitHub Actions workflow for Rust, enabling automated building and testing of the project on pushes and pull requests to the `master` branch.
*   **Commit (9140fc6311):** `Create llms.md`
    *   Introduces `llms.md`, a documentation file outlining the "Bootstrap Microkernel" concept, its 42-stage mathematical lattice architecture, and its core philosophy. It also details the project's documentation, architecture, mathematical foundation, and build/run instructions.
*   **Commit (33910d3e06):** `Merge pull request #1 from meta-introspector/cursor/documentation-review-and-code-cleanup-493e`
    *   A merge commit, likely integrating documentation improvements and code cleanup from a feature branch.

### Branch: `remotes/origin/feature/bootstrap`
*   **Commit (b5c2b5a23e):** `update`
    *   Removes the `fix_rdf_literals` binary from `Cargo.toml` and updates its source file, indicating a change in the handling or necessity of RDF literal fixing. The comment in `fix_rdf_literals.rs` suggests it was an aggressive escaping tool that might be refined later.
*   **Commit (f3e6c8100b):** `ontologies being created`
    *   Adds the `fix_rdf_literals` binary to `Cargo.toml` and creates the `src/bin/fix_rdf_literals.rs` file. This binary is intended for automatically fixing RDF Turtle files, specifically aggressively escaping double quotes. This commit marks the initial introduction of tools for ontology manipulation.
*   **Commit (feef07d7b9):** `built`
    *   Modifies `src/bootstrap_system.rs` and `src/prime_vibe_ontology.rs` to remove a lifetime parameter from `PrimeVibeOntology` and adjust how `RdfGraph` is used, indicating refactoring related to ontology handling and potentially simplifying the data model for prime vibe ontologies.

## Concepts Introduced/Highlighted:
*   **Bootstrap Microkernel:** A minimal, self-contained system designed to integrate mathematical frameworks with semantic processing.
*   **Mathematical Lattice Architecture:** A conceptual framework for organizing the system's components and processes based on mathematical principles, specifically a 42-stage system with OEIS sequences, harmonic lattice, and pharmonic mapping.
*   **Prime Vibe Ontology:** An ontology that maps prime numbers to semantic concepts and associated emojis, forming a core part of the system's self-awareness.
*   **RDF Turtle:** A syntax for RDF (Resource Description Framework) graphs, used for defining ontologies.
*   **Solfunmeme RDF Utils:** Utilities for working with RDF graphs within the Solfunmeme philosophy.
*   **System Commitment:** A cryptographic commitment calculation using kernel cycles, ensuring the integrity and verifiability of the system's state.
*   **Function Number Language:** A system for defining and analyzing functions based on numerical properties.
*   **Phase Mapping:** A system for mapping and analyzing different phases of the bootstrap process.
