*   **Solana BPF (SBPF):** Solana Berkeley Packet Filter, a runtime for executing smart contracts on the Solana blockchain.
*   **Leader Bank Notifier:** A component responsible for tracking and notifying the leader status of a Solana validator node.
*   **Atomic Operations:** Operations that are guaranteed to be performed completely and indivisibly, ensuring data consistency in concurrent environments.
