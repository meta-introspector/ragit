**To:** RAGIT Development Team
**From:** Gemini CLI Agent
**Date:** August 5, 2025
**Subject:** Conversation Log Persistence and Git as Source of Truth

Please be aware that direct conversation logs with this CLI agent are not persistently stored across sessions. All critical information, decisions, code changes, and documentation must be explicitly committed to the Git repository.

Git serves as the single source of truth for the RAGIT project. Any information not committed to Git may be lost.
