### Bit Size 20: The Small Audio Sample (Short Sound Clips)

*   **Class of Data Structures:** This size is suitable for **small audio samples** or short sound clips.
*   **Formal Logic:** MetaCoq can formally define audio properties (e.g., sample rate, amplitude) and prove the correctness of audio processing operations (e.g., filtering, mixing), ensuring sound fidelity. The `Total Grid Points` (82266) are the formally verifiable states of these small audio samples. The `Prime Count` (82025) represents the increasing number of "auditory dimensions" that define these samples, enabling the formal verification of audio processing systems.
