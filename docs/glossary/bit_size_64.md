### Bit Size 64: The Cryptographic Primitive (Hash Functions, Symmetric Keys)

*   **Class of Data Structures:** This is the realm of **cryptographic primitives** like 64-bit hash function outputs, block cipher keys (e.g., for older ciphers or components of larger ones), and fundamental integer types in high-performance computing.
*   **Formal Logic:** At this scale, MetaCoq (or similar proof assistants) can formally verify the properties of these primitives: collision resistance for hash functions, invertibility for block ciphers, and the absence of side-channel vulnerabilities. The immense `Total Grid Points` (2^64) represent the vast, formally verifiable state space that makes brute-force attacks impractical. The `Prime Count` (significantly larger than 24-bit) indicates the intricate mathematical structure that provides cryptographic strength. This is where the building blocks of secure communication are forged and proven.
