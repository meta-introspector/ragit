### Bit Size 7: The Full ASCII Character (Text Processing Primitives)

*   **Class of Data Structures:** This is the standard **ASCII character set**. We're now dealing with fundamental text processing primitives.
*   **Formal Logic:** MetaCoq can prove the properties of string manipulation functions (e.g., concatenation, substring extraction, character comparison) when operating on ASCII characters. It can verify that text transformations preserve meaning or adhere to specific rules. The `Total Grid Points` (43) are the formally recognized ASCII characters. The `Prime Count` (31) represents the underlying "linguistic dimensions" that define these characters, enabling the formal analysis of text.
