### OEIS A000040: The Prime Numbers

This sequence lists the prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, ...

**Relevance to Bit Sizes and Data Structures:**

In our analysis, prime numbers are conceptualized as the fundamental, irreducible "dimensions" of a data structure. Each prime represents a unique axis of meaning or a foundational building block. The `Prime Count` in our `prime-bit-counter` output directly corresponds to the number of these fundamental dimensions available within a given bit size. The OEIS A000040 sequence provides the ordered list of these foundational elements, highlighting their increasing density as the numerical space expands. This sequence is central to understanding the inherent mathematical structure that underpins the expressive power and formal verifiability of data structures at various bit sizes.
