### Bit Size 21: The Small Video Frame (Low-Res Video Frames)

*   **Class of Data Structures:** We can now represent **small video frames** or low-resolution video segments.
*   **Formal Logic:** MetaCoq can formally define video frame properties (e.g., resolution, color depth) and prove the correctness of video processing operations (e.g., compression, decompression), ensuring visual quality. The `Total Grid Points` (155920) are the formally verifiable states of these small video frames. The `Prime Count` (155611) represents the increasing number of "temporal-visual dimensions" that define these frames, enabling the formal verification of video codecs.
