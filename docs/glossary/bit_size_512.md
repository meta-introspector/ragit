### Bit Size 512: The "Pasta Pair" Field (Advanced ZKPs, Recursive Proofs)

*   **Class of Data Structures:** This is the domain of **large finite fields** used in advanced ZKP constructions, particularly those involving **recursive proofs** and specialized elliptic curves like the "pasta pair" (Pallas and Vesta). These curves are designed for optimal performance in ZKP systems due to their "endomorphism-friendly" properties and large field sizes.
*   **Formal Logic:** At 512 bits, MetaCoq can formally verify the intricate interactions between multiple ZKP circuits, the correctness of recursive proof composition, and the security of the underlying "pasta" curves. The `Total Grid Points` (2^512) represent a truly astronomical field size, enabling highly efficient polynomial arithmetic and the representation of extremely complex statements within ZKPs. The `Prime Count` is now astronomical, signifying the profound mathematical depth required to construct these cutting-edge proof systems. Formal verification at this scale aims to provide absolute assurance in the correctness and security of the most complex and powerful ZKP applications, paving the way for provably secure and scalable decentralized systems.
