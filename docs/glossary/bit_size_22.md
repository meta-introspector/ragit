### Bit Size 22: The Small Neural Network Layer (Simple Perceptrons)

*   **Class of Data Structures:** This size can represent a **small neural network layer**, perhaps a simple perceptron or a single neuron with a few weights.
*   **Formal Logic:** MetaCoq can formally define the activation functions, weights, and biases of this layer, proving the correctness of its forward pass and backpropagation. The `Total Grid Points` (296346) are the formally verifiable configurations of this small neural network layer. The `Prime Count` (295947) represents the increasing number of "learning dimensions" that define this layer, enabling the formal verification of AI models.
