### OEIS A000120: Population Count (Number of 1s in Binary Expansion)

This sequence represents the number of 1s in the binary expansion of n (also known as Hamming weight or population count): 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, ...

**Relevance to Bit Sizes and Data Structures:**

While not directly used in our `prime-bit-counter` output, the population count is highly relevant to understanding the **information density and structural properties of data within a given bit size**. In the context of data structures, a higher population count might indicate a more "dense" or "active" state, while a lower count could suggest a "sparse" or "inactive" state. This sequence provides a metric for analyzing the distribution of set bits, which can be crucial for optimizing bitwise operations, understanding memory usage patterns, and even for certain cryptographic applications where Hamming weight plays a role in security. It offers a different lens through which to view the internal composition of our bit-sized data structures.
