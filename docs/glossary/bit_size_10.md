### Bit Size 10: The Small Record (Database Rows, Configuration Entries)

*   **Class of Data Structures:** We enter the realm of **small records** or **configuration entries**. These are structured collections of related data fields.
*   **Formal Logic:** MetaCoq can prove the consistency of data within these records, ensuring that relationships between fields are maintained. It can also verify the correctness of data serialization and deserialization. The `Total Grid Points` (197) are the formally valid record states. The `Prime Count` (172) reflects the increasing number of "data dimensions" that define these records, allowing for more robust data integrity and consistency checks.
