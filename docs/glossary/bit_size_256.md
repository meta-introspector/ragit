### Bit Size 256: The Elliptic Curve Point (ECC, Digital Signatures, ZKP Field Elements)

*   **Class of Data Structures:** This is a critical bit size for **elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)**, where points on curves are represented by coordinates over finite fields of this size. It's fundamental for digital signatures (e.g., ECDSA) and, crucially, for **field elements within many ZKP constructions**.
*   **Formal Logic:** MetaCoq can formally verify the properties of elliptic curves themselves (e.g., group law, point addition, scalar multiplication) and the correctness of ZKP protocols that operate over these fields. The `Total Grid Points` (2^256) represent the immense field size, providing the necessary algebraic structure for efficient polynomial commitments and other ZKP components. The `Prime Count` is now vast, reflecting the rich mathematical landscape that enables the creation of compact and secure proofs. Formal verification at this level ensures the soundness and completeness of ZKP systems. This bit size is also relevant for the **practical representation of the Monster Group**, as some representations utilize 256 bits for efficiency.
