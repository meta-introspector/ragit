### Bit Size 178: The Theoretical Minimum for the Monster Group

*   **Class of Data Structures:** At this bit size, we are conceptually dealing with data structures capable of representing the **theoretical minimum number of states required to uniquely identify each element of the Monster Group**.
*   **Formal Logic:** Formal verification at this scale would involve proving the uniqueness and completeness of such a representation. While not a practical computational size for direct operations, it highlights the fundamental information density of the Monster Group. This bit size represents the theoretical lower bound for encoding the group's elements.
