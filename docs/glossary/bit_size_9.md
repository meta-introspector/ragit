### Bit Size 9: The Small Packet (Network Protocol Headers, Small Messages)

*   **Class of Data Structures:** Ideal for **small network packet headers** or **compact message formats**. These structures are designed for efficient transmission and parsing.
*   **Formal Logic:** MetaCoq can formally define the structure of these packets and prove that parsing functions correctly extract information, and that packet construction adheres to protocol specifications. The `Total Grid Points` (116) are the formally valid packet configurations. The `Prime Count` (97) represents the increasing number of "protocol dimensions" that define these packets, enabling the formal verification of network communication.
