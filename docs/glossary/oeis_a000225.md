### OEIS A000225: Mersenne Numbers (2^n - 1)

This sequence lists the Mersenne numbers, which are of the form 2^n - 1: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, ...

**Relevance to Bit Sizes and Data Structures:**

In our `prime-bit-counter` analysis, `max_val` for a given bit size `n` is calculated as `(1u128 << n) - 1`, which directly corresponds to the Mersenne numbers. This sequence represents the **maximum value that can be stored in an `n`-bit unsigned integer**. It defines the upper bound of the numerical space within which our data structures operate. Understanding this sequence helps us grasp the total theoretical capacity of a given bit size, providing the context for how many "grid points" (ideas) can potentially be formed within that space. It highlights the exponential growth of representable states as bit size increases.
