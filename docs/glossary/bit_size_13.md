### Bit Size 13: The Small Graph Node (Graph Vertices, Network Nodes)

*   **Class of Data Structures:** We can now represent **nodes in small graphs** or **elements in network topologies**. These structures capture relationships between entities.
*   **Formal Logic:** MetaCoq can formally define graph properties (e.g., connectivity, acyclicity) and prove the correctness of graph algorithms (e.g., shortest path, topological sort). The `Total Grid Points` (1077) are the formally valid graph node states. The `Prime Count` (1028) represents the increasing number of "relational dimensions" that define these nodes, enabling the formal verification of distributed systems and complex networks.
