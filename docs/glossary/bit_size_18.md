### Bit Size 18: The Small String (Short Text Sequences)

*   **Class of Data Structures:** We can now represent **small strings** or short sequences of characters.
*   **Formal Logic:** MetaCoq can formally define string properties (e.g., length, character content) and prove the correctness of string manipulation functions (e.g., concatenation, substring search), ensuring text integrity. The `Total Grid Points` (23149) are the formally verifiable states of these small strings. The `Prime Count` (23000) represents the increasing number of "linguistic dimensions" that define these strings, enabling the formal verification of text processing algorithms.
