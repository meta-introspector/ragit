### Godelcraft / Gödelcraft

"Godelcraft" (or "Gödelcraft") appears to be a specific program or system within the project, possibly related to the practical application of Gödel numbering or other Gödelian concepts. It is associated with a "Program ID" and seems to involve mapping numerical representations to concepts like "Gödel number" and "Numerical Theory of Everything (NToE)". The term suggests a craft or engineering approach to building systems based on Gödelian principles.
