### Goedel Number

A Goedel number is a unique number assigned to each symbol and well-formed formula within a formal system. This allows statements about the system to be represented as numbers, enabling self-reference and the exploration of meta-mathematical properties. In the project, Goedel numbers are used to arithmetize code and concepts, bridging formal logic with computational structures.
