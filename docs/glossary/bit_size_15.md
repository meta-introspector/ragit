### Bit Size 15: The Small Database Record (Simple Relational Data)

*   **Class of Data Structures:** We can now represent **simple database records** or **rows in small relational tables**. These structures are the foundation of structured data management.
*   **Formal Logic:** MetaCoq can formally define database schemas and prove the correctness of SQL-like queries, ensuring data consistency and integrity across the database. The `Total Grid Points` (3589) are the formally valid database record states. The `Prime Count` (3512) represents the increasing number of "data integrity dimensions" that define these records, enabling the formal verification of database systems.
