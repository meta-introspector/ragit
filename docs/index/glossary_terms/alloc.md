# ALLOC

`ALLOC` is a shorthand for memory allocation. In this project, it is used to refer to the process of reserving a block of memory for a specific purpose. This is a fundamental operation in many parts of the system, and it is important to manage memory carefully to avoid leaks and other problems.
