title: simulate_hype_cycle_and_inference_orchestration
---

This function is part of the bootstrapping process and is responsible for simulating a "hype cycle" and orchestrating inference. This likely involves managing the flow of data and models during the initial setup and operation of the `ragit` system, especially in the context of its "Grand Plan" and AI-driven functionalities.

**Purpose:** To simulate and manage the dynamic aspects of the `ragit` system's operation, including how information spreads and how AI models are utilized for inference.

**Key Files/Contexts:**
- `crates/layer1_physical/ragit-core/src/grand_plan/bootstrapper/bootstrap_orchestrator.rs`: Shows `simulate_hype_cycle_and_inference_orchestration` being called within the `bootstrap_orchestrator`.
- `crates/layer1_physical/ragit-core/src/grand_plan/bootstrapper/phases/simulate_hype_cycle.rs`: Contains the definition of the `simulate_hype_cycle_and_inference_orchestration` function.
