# Ontology

In the context of this project, an "ontology" is a formal specification of a set of concepts and the relationships between them. It is used to create a shared understanding of a domain, and to enable communication and interoperability between different systems. The project uses ontologies to model the relationships between different concepts, such as files, chunks, and embeddings.
