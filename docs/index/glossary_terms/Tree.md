title: Tree
---

In `ragit`, `Tree` primarily refers to various tree-like data structures used for organizing and representing data, particularly in the context of the "Grand Plan" and the underlying data structures for indexing and knowledge representation. It can also refer to the `usvg::Tree` for SVG image processing.

**Purpose:** Trees are fundamental for hierarchical data organization, efficient searching, and representing relationships between different data entities within `ragit`.

**Key Files/Contexts:**
- `src/agent/file_tree.rs`, `crates/legacy_and_refactoring/ragit-agent/src/file_tree.rs`: `FileTree` struct, used for representing file system structures.
- `src/index/file/image.rs`: `usvg::Tree` for SVG parsing.
- `crates/layer1_physical/ragit-core/src/grand_plan/trees/`: Contains `fundamental_unit_tree.rs` and `node_tree.rs`, which are core tree data structures.
- `crates/layer1_physical/ragit-core/src/grand_plan/id_indexed_trees/`: Contains `universe_struct.rs`, `unit_ref_enum.rs`, `node_struct.rs`, `leaf_struct.rs`, which are related to ID-indexed trees.
- `crates/layer1_physical/ragit-core/src/grand_plan/binary_tree_generators/`: Contains `build_tree_recursive.rs` and `generate_power_of_two_trees.rs` for generating binary trees.
- `crates/layer1_physical/ragit-core/src/grand_plan/bott_periodic_lambdas/lambda_3_the_tree.rs`: `the_tree` function, related to generating a tree.
- `crates/layer1_physical/ragit-core/src/grand_plan/poem_concepts/tree/tree_struct.rs`: Defines a `Tree` struct within the "poem concepts."
- `crates/layer1_physical/ragit-core/src/grand_plan/system_unification_numbers/numerical_unifier/concept_mappers/unify_system_concept.rs`: Mentions "Tree" in the context of concept mapping.
