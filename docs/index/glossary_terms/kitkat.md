# KitKat

A "KitKat" or a "KitKat moment" is a meta-program for taking a well-deserved break. It signifies a point in the development process where it is appropriate to pause, commit the current work, and conceptually reboot before starting the next phase.

It is a reminder to celebrate progress and to approach the next challenge with a fresh perspective.
