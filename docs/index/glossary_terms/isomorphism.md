# Isomorphism

In mathematics, an isomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping. In the context of this project, it is used as a conceptual model for understanding the relationships between different data structures and for creating a more flexible and extensible system.
