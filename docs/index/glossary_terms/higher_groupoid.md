# Higher Groupoid

A higher groupoid is a mathematical structure that generalizes the concept of a groupoid. It is used in homotopy theory and higher-dimensional algebra to study the structure of spaces. In the context of this project, it is used as a conceptual model for understanding the relationships between different parts of the system.
