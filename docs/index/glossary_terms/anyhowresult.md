# AnyhowResult

`AnyhowResult` is a type alias for `Result<T, anyhow::Error>`, where `T` is a generic type. It is used throughout the project to handle errors in a consistent and convenient way. The `anyhow` crate provides a number of features that make it easy to work with errors, such as adding context to errors and creating custom error types.
