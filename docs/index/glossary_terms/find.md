title: Find
---

In the context of the ragit codebase, **Find** is a more general term used for utility functions that locate specific pieces of data. This is distinct from the more complex `search` and `query` operations.

An example of this is the `model_find_api_key_in_file` function, which is designed to find a model's API key within a configuration file. These "find" operations are typically direct lookups or simple searches within a limited scope.
