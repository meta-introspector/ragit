The `execute_chunk` function is responsible for processing and executing a given `RagitChunk`. This implies that `RagitChunk` can contain executable code or instructions that need to be run.

**Purpose:** To enable dynamic behavior and processing of chunks within the `ragit` system, potentially for tasks like running embedded scripts, executing specific data transformations, or interacting with external systems.

**Key Files/Contexts:**

- `crates/layer1_physical/ragit-core/src/grand_plan/living_chunks_system/chunk_executor/chunk_executor_function.rs`: Contains the definition of the `execute_chunk` function.
