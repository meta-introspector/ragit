`UnimathConcept` is an enum that represents various mathematical and logical concepts within the context of `ragit`'s integration with Unimath (likely a reference to Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations). It includes concepts like propositions, types, and axioms.

**Purpose:** To provide a structured way to represent and manipulate formal mathematical concepts within the `ragit` system, enabling advanced reasoning and knowledge representation.

**Key Files/Contexts:**
