title: UnimathConcept
---

`UnimathConcept` is an enum that represents various mathematical and logical concepts within the context of `ragit`'s integration with Unimath (likely a reference to Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations). It includes concepts like propositions, types, and axioms.

**Purpose:** To provide a structured way to represent and manipulate formal mathematical concepts within the `ragit` system, enabling advanced reasoning and knowledge representation.

**Key Files/Contexts:**
- `crates/layer1_physical/ragit-core/src/grand_plan/lean4_integration/unimath_concept/unimath_concept_enum.rs`: Contains the definition of the `UnimathConcept` enum.
- `crates/layer1_physical/ragit-core/src/grand_plan/lean4_integration/unification_engine/unification_engine_structs.rs`: Shows `UnimathConcept` being used in the context of unifying concepts.
