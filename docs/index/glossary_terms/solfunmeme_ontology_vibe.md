## solfunmeme_ontology_vibe

A Rust crate within the Solfunmeme-Dioxus project specifically designed to encapsulate and manage interactions with the `sophia` RDF library. Its primary purpose is to:

*   **Isolate `sophia` interactions:** Abstracting the complexities of `sophia`'s API from other parts of the codebase.
*   **Improve Modularity:** Centralizing RDF-related logic to enhance the overall modularity of the project.
*   **Simplify Interfaces:** Providing a higher-level, more user-friendly interface for common RDF operations.
*   **Facilitate Integration:** Designed to integrate RDF graph management with Dioxus rendering and Solana PDA (Program Derived Address) integration.

This crate plays a crucial role in defining and manipulating the project's ontologies, particularly in the context of semantic resonance and vibe-driven architectural evolution.
