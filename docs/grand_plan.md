# Grand Plan: Fundamental Size Structure

1. we create a pair of chars, then a triple, then 5,7,11,17,19.
2. then 2^2,2^3,2^5...2^19, then 3^2,3^3....3^19, then 19^19.
3. then we can go to 2^2^2 and so forth as needed.
4. each time we sample that amount of chars, or words, or tree, or groups etc.
5. that is our fundamental size structure.
