# The Grand Plan: An Autonomous, Self-Improving Development Agent

## 1. Vision

This document outlines the grand plan for the evolution of this Gemini CLI agent into a fully autonomous, self-improving software development entity. The agent will leverage its own API to perform a comprehensive range of software engineering tasks, from simple code modifications to complex, multi-step development workflows. The ultimate goal is to create a system that can independently develop, test, and deploy new versions of itself, continuously expanding its capabilities and improving its performance.

## 2. Core Capabilities

The agent will be built upon a set of core capabilities, each enabled by the strategic use of its own API:

*   **Code Modification**: The agent will use the `read_file`, `write_file`, and `replace` tools to modify its own source code and the source code of other projects. This will allow it to fix bugs, add new features, and refactor code.

*   **Code Discovery**: The agent will use the `glob` and `search_file_content` tools to navigate and understand complex codebases. This will enable it to find relevant code for a given task, identify dependencies, and understand the overall architecture of a project.

*   **Build and Test**: The agent will use the `run_shell_command` tool to build, test, and validate its changes. This will ensure that all modifications are correct, do not introduce regressions, and meet the project's quality standards.

*   **Self-Update**: The agent will have the ability to update its own source code and restart itself with new capabilities. This will be achieved by modifying its own source code, building a new version of itself, and then executing the new version.

*   **LLM Interaction**: The agent will be able to use its own API to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs). This will enable it to perform higher-level reasoning, generate code, and get feedback on its own work.

*   **Automated Reporting**: The agent will be able to automatically generate reports on the changes it has made and the results of its tests. This will provide a clear and concise record of its work, making it easy to track its progress and identify any issues.

## 3. Workflow

The agent will follow a structured workflow to ensure that all tasks are completed efficiently and correctly:

1.  **Receive Task**: The agent will receive a high-level task from the user, such as "add a new feature to the quiz server" or "refactor the authentication logic."

2.  **Plan**: The agent will break down the task into a series of smaller, executable steps. This will involve analyzing the codebase, identifying the necessary changes, and creating a detailed plan of action.

3.  **Execute**: The agent will use its API to execute the steps in its plan. This may involve modifying code, running tests, and interacting with LLMs.

4.  **Verify**: The agent will verify that its changes are correct and meet the requirements of the task. This will involve running tests, performing static analysis, and getting feedback from LLMs.

5.  **Report**: The agent will report the results of its work to the user. This will include a summary of the changes it has made, the results of its tests, and any issues it encountered.

6.  **Iterate**: The agent will continuously improve its own code and capabilities. This will involve analyzing its own performance, identifying areas for improvement, and using its own API to make the necessary changes.

## 4. Conclusion

This grand plan outlines a vision for a new kind of software development agent: one that is autonomous, self-improving, and capable of performing a wide range of software engineering tasks. By leveraging its own API, the agent will be able to continuously evolve and expand its capabilities, ultimately becoming a powerful tool for software development.
