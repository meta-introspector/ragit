# Task: Restore Multi-Search Functionality

## Current Status

We are in the process of restoring the multi-search functionality to the `spinoffs/model-builder-quiz` submodule. This feature was previously implemented in the `ragit-embedding-quiz` crate and was partially lost during the consolidation into the submodule.

## Completed Steps

1.  Reviewed git history to identify the "wip" commit containing the multi-search implementation.
2.  Updated `spinoffs/model-builder-quiz/src/handlers.rs` with the `handle_query_command` and `handle_add_vector_command` functions.
3.  Updated `spinoffs/model-builder-quiz/src/cli_run.rs` to call the new handlers from `handlers.rs`.

## Next Steps

1.  Restore the `term_embeddings.json` file with the content from the "wip" commit.
2.  Create the `docs/training_data_v2.json` file with the content from the "wip" commit.
3.  Create documentation for the training data in `spinoffs/model-builder-quiz/docs/testing_data.md`.
4.  Restore the `ontologies/hyperspace.ttl` file.
5.  Update the `spinoffs/model-builder-quiz/README.md` to reflect the current status and functionality.
