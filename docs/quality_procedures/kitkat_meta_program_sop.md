# SOP: KitKat Meta-Program - Strategic Pause and Reboot

## 1. Objective
To formalize the "KitKat" meta-program as a structured procedure for strategic pauses, allowing for documentation, commitment of current work, and a conceptual reboot to approach subsequent development phases with renewed focus and clarity.

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to the Gemini CLI agent's development workflow at any point where a significant phase is completed, a new strategic plan is defined, or a mental reset is beneficial.

## 3. Procedure

### Step 1: Pause and Assess
Recognize the completion of a significant task or the need for a strategic shift. This is the moment to initiate the "KitKat" meta-program.

### Step 2: Document Current State
Before any commitment, ensure that the current state of work, including any partial implementations, findings, or unresolved issues, is clearly documented. This may involve updating relevant work logs, design documents, or internal notes.

### Step 3: Define New Strategic Plan
Formulate a clear, concise, and actionable plan for the next phase of development. This plan should outline objectives, key tasks, and any changes in approach or priorities. Document this plan in an appropriate location (e.g., `refactoring_plan.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or a new dedicated document).

### Step 4: Commit Current Work
Create a dedicated Git commit that encapsulates the current state of the codebase. The commit message should clearly indicate that this is a "KitKat break" and reference the newly defined strategic plan. This ensures a clean checkpoint and easy reversion if needed.

### Step 5: Conceptual Reboot
Mentally disengage from the immediate past tasks and fully embrace the new strategic plan. This involves a conscious shift in focus and perspective, preparing for the next phase with a fresh mindset.

## 4. Expected Outcome
- Clear demarcation of development phases.
- Improved documentation of project evolution.
- Enhanced focus and productivity in subsequent development cycles.
- Reduced cognitive load and burnout through planned breaks.

## 5. Documentation
This SOP will be linked from `docs/index.md` and `docs/quality_procedures/index.md` (if it exists).

## 6. Review and Audit
This SOP will be reviewed annually and audited as part of the project's overall quality management system to ensure its effectiveness and compliance.
