## 2025-08-08 - Commit: Fix: Update Cargo.toml files and sophia_rs submodule for mownstr vendoring.

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `Cargo.toml` to correctly define `[workspace.package]` fields (edition, version, authors, keywords, license, repository, documentation, description, homepage) and added `mownstr`, `regex`, `resiter`, `serde`, `thiserror`, `test-case`, and `toml` to `[workspace.dependencies]`.
- Modified `crates/layer7_application/ragit-dyim/Cargo.toml` to explicitly use the vendored `mownstr` path.
- Updated the `vendor/meta-introspector/solfunmeme-dioxus` submodule (which contains `sophia_rs`) to reflect changes related to `mownstr` vendoring.

**Rationale:** These changes were necessary to resolve persistent manifest parsing errors and dependency inheritance issues that were blocking the `ragit-dyim` build. By explicitly defining workspace-level metadata and vendoring `mownstr`, we aim to provide a stable and controlled dependency environment.
