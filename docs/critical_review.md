# Critical Review - term_quiz_master

**Date:** August 6, 2025

This document outlines the findings of a critical review of the `term_quiz_master` crate.

## Issues Found:

1.  **Missing Tests:** The crate has no tests. This makes it difficult to verify the functionality of the program and prevent regressions.
2.  **Compiler Warnings:** The following warnings were found during compilation:
    *   `unused import: `toml`` in `crates/term_quiz_master/src/update_logic/run_update_command.rs`
    *   `field `stopwords` is never read` in `crates/term_quiz_master/src/update_logic/run_update_command.rs`
3.  **Runtime Error:** The program fails to run with the following error:
    *   `Error: Error("missing field `versions`", line: 10, column: 5)`

## Recommendations:

1.  **Implement Tests:** Add a comprehensive test suite to the crate to cover all its functionality.
2.  **Fix Compiler Warnings:** Remove the unused import and the unused field to clean up the code.
3.  **Investigate Runtime Error:** The runtime error needs to be investigated and fixed. It seems to be related to a missing `versions` field in a configuration file.
