# Introspection Method for Ragit Codebase

The "Introspection Method" is a systematic approach to understanding, debugging, and optimizing the Ragit codebase by instrumenting the code to explain its internal workings at runtime. This method focuses on gaining deep insights into function execution, data flow, and resource utilization, particularly concerning index operations.

## Core Principles:

1.  **Self-Explanatory Code:** Modify functions to output detailed logs about their execution, including inputs, intermediate states, and outputs. This transforms the code into a self-documenting entity during runtime.
2.  **Monadic Interface for Instrumentation:** Utilize a monadic interface (e.g., a `Result` or `Option` type in Rust, or a similar pattern) to wrap function calls, allowing for consistent interception and logging of execution flow, error handling, and return values without cluttering the core logic.
3.  **Runtime and Utility Inspection:**
    *   **Runtime Analysis:** Capture metrics such as function execution time, memory consumption, and CPU usage for critical paths.
    *   **Utility Analysis:** Evaluate the effectiveness and necessity of each function and code block. Identify redundant, unused, or inefficient sections.

## Specific Focus Areas for Index Operations:

When applying introspection to index-related functions (e.g., `Index::load`, `Index::add_chunk`, `query`), the following details will be specifically instrumented and logged:

*   **Index File Reading:**
    *   Confirmation of `index.json` and object files being read.
    *   Paths of files being read.
    *   Success or failure of file reads.
*   **Chunk Processing:**
    *   **Chunks Read:** Total number of chunks successfully read from source files.
    *   **Chunks Skipped:** Number of chunks that were intentionally or unintentionally skipped during processing (e.g., due to filtering, errors, or empty content).
    *   **Chunks Found:** Number of chunks identified and processed by the text splitter.
    *   **Chunks Added to Index:** Number of chunks successfully added to the in-memory `Index` structure.
*   **Query Results:**
    *   Raw results returned by the query engine.
    *   Processed or filtered results presented to the user.
    *   Any intermediate steps in query execution (e.g., TF-IDF calculations, reranking).

## Identifying Code Issues:

Through this detailed introspection, we aim to identify:

*   **Skipped Code:** Code paths that are never executed under normal or test conditions.
*   **Unimplemented Code:** Placeholder functions or sections marked as "TODO" or "unimplemented!" that are critical for functionality but not yet fully developed.
*   **Inefficient Code:** Sections that consume excessive resources (time, memory, CPU) relative to their output, indicating potential for optimization. This includes:
    *   Unnecessary data copying.
    *   Suboptimal algorithms.
    *   Redundant computations.
    *   Excessive I/O operations.

## Reporting:

The findings from the introspection process will be documented in a detailed report, including:

*   Instrumented code snippets.
*   Runtime logs and metrics.
*   Analysis of skipped, unimplemented, and inefficient code.
*   Recommendations for improvements and optimizations.
