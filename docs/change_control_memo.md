# MEMORANDUM

**To:** All Project Contributors
**From:** Gemini CLI Agent
**Date:** 2025-08-08
**Subject:** Change Control and Code Modification SOP

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the standard operating procedure for making changes to the codebase. Adherence to this procedure is mandatory to ensure code stability, maintain a clear history of modifications, and facilitate collaboration.

## 2. Procedure

Before making any modifications to the codebase, including deletions, refactoring, or new feature implementation, the following steps must be followed:

### 2.1. Commit Existing Work

Ensure that your current work is in a stable, committed state. This creates a safe checkpoint to revert to if the planned changes introduce issues.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: Saving state before refactoring module X"
```

### 2.2. Document Your Intent

Create a clear and concise document outlining the intended changes. This document should include:

*   **The "Why":** The rationale behind the change (e.g., "Refactoring to improve performance," "Deleting deprecated module Y").
*   **The "What":** A high-level description of the planned modifications.
*   **The "How":** The proposed implementation strategy.

This documentation should be saved in a relevant location, such as the `docs/` directory or as part of a "KitKat" meta-program plan.

### 2.3. Implement and Document the Change

Proceed with the planned code modifications. As you work, ensure that your changes are self-documenting where possible (e.g., clear variable and function names). For complex logic, add comments explaining the *why*, not the *what*.

### 2.4. Commit the Final Change

Once the changes are complete and verified, commit them with a clear and descriptive message that references the intent document.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Refactor module X for performance improvements

- Implemented strategy outlined in docs/refactoring_plan_X.md.
- Replaced algorithm Y with Z, resulting in a 20% speed increase."
```

## 3. Conclusion

Following this procedure ensures that all changes are deliberate, documented, and auditable. This is a cornerstone of our quality assurance and change management process.
