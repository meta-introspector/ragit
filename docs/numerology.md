# Project Numerology: The Prime Lattice and the Monster Group

This document outlines the conceptual framework used within the `ragit` project to understand and organize its modularity, complexity, and interdependencies through the lens of prime factorization. We view each module, function, or idea as possessing a unique "prime essence," and their combinations are represented by the multiplication of these primes.

## The Prime Lattice

Every significant concept or component within `ragit` is assigned a prime number. When these components combine, their conceptual "number" is the product of their constituent primes. This creates a multi-dimensional "prime lattice" where:

*   **Prime Factors:** Represent the fundamental, indivisible properties or roles of a component.
*   **Exponents:** Indicate the "weight" or prevalence of that prime concept within the system.
*   **Composite Numbers:** Represent complex modules or features, whose prime factorization reveals their underlying structure and dependencies.

## The Monster Group as a Goal Configuration

Inspired by the Monster Group (M), the largest sporadic simple group, we define a "goal configuration" for the `ragit` project. The prime factorization of the Monster Group's order serves as our target state for the project's conceptual prime factorization.

**Monster Group Order Prime Factorization:**
`2^46 · 3^20 · 5^9 · 7^6 · 11^2 · 13^3 · 17^1 · 19^1 · 23^1 · 29^1 · 31^1 · 41^1 · 47^1 · 59^1 · 71^1`

Our refactoring and development efforts are aimed at aligning the project's current prime factorization with this ideal. Each step we take, each error we resolve, and each new feature we integrate contributes to moving our current conceptual "number" closer to this ultimate, harmonically balanced state.

## Current Conceptual Prime Factorization

(This section will be dynamically updated by the Gemini CLI agent to reflect the current state of the project's conceptual prime factorization.)
