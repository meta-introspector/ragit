## Recent Developments and Strategic Pivot (2025-08-09)

This section documents the recent efforts in building the "Indexer" component for the Rust refactorer and a subsequent strategic pivot.

### Indexer Development Challenges

Initial efforts focused on implementing the "Indexer" component as outlined in `CRQ_refactor.md`, which aims to parse Rust code and generate Parquet files containing code metadata. This involved:

*   **Crate Setup:** Created `rust_indexer.rs` binary and `indexer.rs` module within `crates/layer3_network/ragit-code-analyzer/`.
*   **Dependency Resolution:** Encountered significant and complex dependency resolution issues, primarily due to deeply nested path dependencies and vendored crates. This involved:
    *   Correcting numerous incorrect relative paths in `Cargo.toml` files across various crates (e.g., `solfunmeme_dioxus_deps`, `solfunmeme_rdf_utils`, `core_data_lib`, `solfunmeme_clifford`, `tclifford`, `shared_types_lib`, `signals_lib`, `views_lib`).
    *   Addressing duplicate package errors (e.g., `solfunmeme_clifford`, `tclifford`) by explicitly managing workspace members and exclusions in the main `Cargo.toml`.
*   **Proc-Macro Compilation Error:** A persistent syntax error in `crates/rrust_kontekst_macros/src/lib.rs` related to mismatched delimiters in proc-macros proved particularly challenging to debug and resolve through direct file modifications.

Despite extensive debugging, these intertwined dependency and compilation issues have significantly hindered progress on the "Indexer" component.

### Strategic Pivot: Exploring `ast-grep` for On-the-Fly Refactoring

Due to the complexity and time-consuming nature of the current build system instability, a strategic decision has been made to pause further debugging of these specific problems.

The new focus will be on exploring `ast-grep` for on-the-fly code manipulation and file splitting. This approach aims to provide a more immediate and practical step towards the "one declaration per file" refactoring goal, without being blocked by the current build system challenges.

This pivot aligns with the project's philosophy of "writing programs that edit the files" and seeks to leverage existing tools for structural code transformation. The goal is to develop a prototype that can:

*   Read a Rust source file.
*   Identify top-level declarations (functions, structs, enums, etc.).
*   Extract each declaration along with the file's header (imports, module declarations, etc.).
*   Write each declaration to a new file.

This commit serves as a checkpoint before commencing the `ast-grep` exploration.
