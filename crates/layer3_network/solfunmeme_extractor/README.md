# `solfunmeme_extractor`

This crate is responsible for extracting code snippets, functions, and other relevant information from source code files.

## Purpose

It serves as a crucial component in the code analysis pipeline, breaking down large codebases into manageable and analyzable units, which can then be further processed, indexed, or visualized.

## Core Functionalities

-   **Code Snippet Extraction**: Identifies and extracts distinct code blocks or functions from source files.
-   **Function Analysis**: Analyzes extracted functions to gather metadata and semantic summaries.
-   **File Processing**: Orchestrates the extraction process for entire files or directories.

## Usage (Conceptual)

```rust
// use solfunmeme_extractor::Extractor;

// fn main() {
//     let extractor = Extractor::new();
//     let code = "fn main() { println!(\"Hello\"); }";
//     // let extracted_info = extractor.extract_from_string(code).expect("Failed to extract");
//     // println!("Extracted info (conceptual): {:?}", extracted_info);
// }
```
