# `shared_types_lib`

This crate defines general-purpose shared types and utilities that are used across multiple modules and crates within the Solfunmeme project.

## Purpose

It provides common definitions for basic data structures, enums, and helper functions that are not specific to any particular domain (e.g., analysis, UI, or blockchain integration) but are broadly applicable throughout the application.

## Core Data Structures

-   *(Add specific types here as they are defined in the crate)*

## Usage (Conceptual)

```rust
// use shared_types_lib::{MySharedType};

// fn main() {
//     let my_instance = MySharedType { /* ... */ };
// }
```
