# RAGIT WebAssembly Vision: Universal Knowledge Base

## The Big Idea

Transform RAGIT into a ubiquitous knowledge system by compiling to WebAssembly and embedding into every website via browser extensions or userscripts. This creates a personal knowledge graph that grows with your browsing.

## Core Concept

```
Traditional RAG: Files â†’ Chunks â†’ Index â†’ Query
Web RAG:        Websites â†’ Chunks â†’ Index â†’ Query (everywhere)
```

Every webpage becomes part of your searchable knowledge base, accessible instantly from any site.

## Technical Architecture

### LLVM â†’ WASM Compilation
- Rust's excellent WASM support via `wasm-pack`
- Core RAGIT functionality compiled to browser-compatible modules
- File I/O replaced with browser APIs (IndexedDB, localStorage)

### Browser Integration Approaches

1. **Chrome Extension** (Implemented)
   - Manifest v3 compatibility
   - Content scripts on all URLs
   - Popup interface + keyboard shortcuts
   - Local storage persistence

2. **Userscript/Tampermonkey** (Future)
   - Single-file deployment
   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - Easy sharing and installation

### Key Features

- **Automatic Page Indexing**: Every page visit adds to knowledge base
- **Instant Search**: Ctrl+Shift+R for universal search overlay
- **TF-IDF Powered**: Maintains RAGIT's keyword-based approach
- **AI Summarization**: Generate page summaries for better retrieval
- **Cross-Site Linking**: Connect related information across domains

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- Basic WASM bindings (`RagitWeb`, `BrowserExtractor`)
- Chrome extension with keyboard shortcuts
- Content extraction and storage
- Simple keyword-based search
- Build system and documentation

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Integration with core RAGIT chunking logic
- TF-IDF search implementation
- AI-powered summarization

### ðŸ“‹ Roadmap
- Userscript version for Tampermonkey
- Cross-device synchronization
- Advanced filtering and tagging
- PDF and image content support
- Collaborative knowledge sharing

## Revolutionary Potential

This approach transforms web browsing from passive consumption to active knowledge building:

1. **Personal Research Assistant**: Every page you read becomes queryable
2. **Cross-Reference Engine**: Find connections between disparate sources
3. **Memory Augmentation**: Never lose track of information you've seen
4. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Share knowledge bases with teams
5. **Universal Context**: AI assistants with access to your browsing history

## Chat Discussion Summary

**Human**: "lets imagine we can compile via llvm to wasm and then embed our system via userscripts/tampermoney or chrome browser extensions into all websites"

**Response**: Created complete WASM crate with:
- WebAssembly bindings for RAGIT core functionality
- Browser extension with content scripts and popup
- Keyboard shortcuts for seamless interaction
- Local storage for persistence
- Build system for easy deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Search**: Integrate full RAGIT TF-IDF engine
2. **AI Integration**: Add summarization and keyword extraction
3. **Performance**: Optimize for real-time web browsing
4. **Distribution**: Package for Chrome Web Store
5. **Expansion**: Support Firefox, Safari, and userscript platforms

## Vision Statement

*"Turn the entire web into your personal, searchable knowledge base - accessible from anywhere, growing with every page you visit."*

This represents a fundamental shift from document-based RAG to web-based RAG, making knowledge management as natural as browsing.
