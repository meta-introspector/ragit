feat: Documented candle build fix and identified new dependency issues

This commit documents the initial steps taken to address compilation issues with the vendored `candle` crate, specifically by commenting out the `gemm` dependency in `vendor/meta-introspector/solfunmeme-dioxus/vendor/candle/Cargo.toml`.

During the verification build, a new set of errors emerged, indicating missing dependencies in the main `ragit` crate's `Cargo.toml`. These new issues are also noted in the `candle_build_fix.md` SOP.

This commit serves as a "KitKat" checkpoint, documenting the current state and outlining the next steps for dependency resolution in the main `ragit` project.
