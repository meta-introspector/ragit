feat: Prepare for reboot - Candle refactoring checkpoint

This commit marks a checkpoint in the `candle` refactoring process, preparing for a system reboot.

Key progress includes:
- Successful removal of the `gemm` dependency from the `candle` build.
- Significant refactoring of `candle-core/src/cpu_backend/mod.rs` into individual operation files within `cpu_backend/ops/`.
- Resolution of several syntax errors in the newly created `ops/` files.

Next steps after reboot will focus on completing the `cpu_storage.rs` split and verifying the `candle-core` build.

KitKat Break initiated.
