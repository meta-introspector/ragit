## Copilot-Friendly Project Principles & Refactoring Guidelines

### Key Operational Principles

- **"One Declaration Per File":**  
  Each struct, enum, or function should live in its own file for maximum modularity and reusability.
- **Modularity & Separation:**  
  Extract distinct functionality into separate modules/crates; group related utilities.
- **Consistent Interfaces:**  
  Use `PathBuf` for filesystem work, maintain uniform command/APIs, and keep module re-exports (`mod.rs`) clear.
- **Loose Coupling:**  
  Use `prelude` modules and wildcard imports (`use *`) to reduce tight dependencies between modules.
- **Visibility:**  
  Expose only what’s necessary with `pub`, keep internals encapsulated.
- **Automate Refactors:**  
  Don’t edit files directly—write scripts/tools to perform systematic changes.

### Refactoring Patterns

- **Index Methods:**  
  Change methods on the `Index` struct (e.g., `index.method()`) into standalone functions like `index_method()`.
- **Async Operations:**  
  Ensure async functions handle data ownership and lifetimes properly.
- **Macros:**  
  Use string literals for macros like `format!` and `writeln!`; constants don’t work in the first argument.
- **Flush I/O:**  
  Always `use std::io::Write;` in files that call `flush()`.

### Project Structure: Prime-Number Grouping

- **Binary (2):**  
  Function/unit test pairs, struct/impl pairs, input/output pairs.
- **Trinity (3):**  
  Core data, logic, and I/O per module; API/implementation/CLI groupings.
- **Quintessence (5):**  
  Crates with five main submodules or commands.
- **Layers (7):**  
  Seven architectural layers (CLI, API, Logic, Storage, Schema, Utilities, Integrations).
- **Cycles (19):**  
  Full development cycle: observe, abstract, decompose, implement, integrate, refine, verify, iterate, etc.

### Current Refactoring Status

- Refactoring `grand_plan` module: moving to "one module = one concept = one function = one vibe".
- Applied conceptual derive macros (e.g., `#[derive(OurMacro)]`) to refactored items.
- Documentation and plans tracked in `refactoring_plan.md` and `docs/grand_plan.md`.
- TODO:  
  - Update all `mod.rs` and `use` statements after refactor.
  - Verify integration/tests and conceptual integrity.

### Recent Fixes

- Added `--verbose` flag for debugging.
- Fixed build failures due to prompt directory copy timing.
- Split large functions for clarity and testability.
- Ensured error types are `Clone` where needed, removed conflicting `From` impls.
- Resolved issues with Rust macros and visibility.

**Copilot advice:**  
When contributing, always make changes by writing or updating Rust scripts/tools for systematic codebase edits, and follow the one-declaration-per-file and modularity principles. Use and update the provided documentation to track your changes and rationale.

If you have specific tasks or want Copilot to help automate a refactor, describe the target module or function and the transformation you want!
